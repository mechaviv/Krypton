        <string name="1" value="I asked Lukan about the Inner Sanctum Gate, and as I surmised, he knew how to get in.  Being a well-respected Stormcaster Knight, he was given a #bCrimsonwood Keystone#k by the Keep's Grandmasters.  However, Lukan thinks that I'm mad to assault the castle and refuses to give me the key, calling it a suicide mission.  However, if I can whittle down the Keep's defenders, he'll relent and give me the Keystone.  I've already put the hurt on the Stormbreakers, but I'll need to defeat at least #b75 Windraiders, 75 Firebrands#k, and #b75 Nightshadows#k more to put a sizeable enough dent in this evil army!" />
        <string name="2" value="I defeated the twisted Crimsonwood warriors!  And true to his word, Lukan gave me his #bCrimsonwood Keystone#k.  He also said that although the Keystone will physically unlock the Inner Sanctum Gate, the red energy field that surrounds them is foreign to him, and likely a new addition by the Keep's new Masters.  I should take the key back to Jack Barricade and let him know what I've discovered." />

However, I'm still not really sure why they're camped out here in the middle of these haunted woods.  Their leader, a mysterious tough named #bTaggrin#k, seems quite unfriendly to strangers.  Taggrin said that there was one thing I could do however: #bcut down the possessed Phantom Trees#b and bring him #b25#k of their #bseeds#k.  I'm not sure why he wants them, but I guess the fewer angry trees around the better for everyone. " />

Warning me that this would be no easy task, he explained that the wraiths are the souls of brave Crimsonwood Keep warriors who fell in battle in the forest, protecting the Keep from the invading Krakians.  Never given a proper burial, they have become mindless undead, threatening the Keep's foes and innocent travelers alike.  With these ashes, Taggrin intends to give these noble lost souls the final rest they so rightfully deserve." />

The world of Versal is usually shrouded in darkness; Versalmas is an annual holiday that celebrates the emergence of the sun in their world, which shines for 90 straight days and only for these 90 days.  For Versalmas, children receive presents every day for the first 30 days, and get cool treats like Sugar-coated Olives and Caramel Onions! Sounds pretty awesome...

Now that Jack's made it up to the Crimsonwood Mountain, he's given the map to me for my own use.  Perhaps I should return it to Taggrin?

Now she doesn't know what sounds more exciting - Maplemas... or Versalmas?  Suzy needs my help to help her decide which version of X-mas she should celebrate this year.  In order to do that, I'll have to speak to both Maple Claws and this O-Pongo character, and then come back and talk to her.  Maplemas holiday from an alternate dimension, huh?  Very curious..." />
        <string name="2" value="I spoke to both Maple Claws and O-Pongo.  It seems that both Maplemas and Versalmas have their merits.  In the end, Suzy's put the decision on me: she's asked me to deliver her X-mas Wishlist to one of the two 'Santas,' which will determine which holiday she's celebrating this year.  I have a feeling that this decision is important, that I'm not just making a choice for her... but also one for myself.  Which holiday do I believe in?" />

        <string name="2" value="Versal Power! I spoke with O-Pongo, the Versalmas Mouse, who is the 'Santa' for the Versal version of Maplemas, and learned a great deal about Versalmas.  He told me about the customs for their holiday--quite different from the Maple World! The world of Versal is usually shrouded in darkness; Versalmas is an annual holiday that celebrates the emergence of the sun in their world, which shines for 90 straight days and only for these 90 days.  For Versalmas, children receive presents every day for the first 30 days, and get cool treats like Sugar-coated Olives and Caramel Onions! Sounds pretty awesome... Now I'd better speak with Maple Claws and head back to Suzy... It makes me wonder for myself though, which holiday would I pick to celebrate?  Hmmm..." />
