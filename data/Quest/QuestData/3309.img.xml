        <string name="1" value="Bedin told me to enter the lab of Alcadno when no one is present, and steal the #b#t4031708##k for him. Apparently, it can be found on top of the table at #b#m261020700##k... but in order to get to #m261020700#, I'll have to use the portal from #m261020600#. Since all the lights are off at the lab, I'll have to really search for the document in the dark... \n\n#i4031708##t4031708# #b#c4031708##k/1" />
        <string name="2" value="An incident from long ago. It all started with a flawed experiment from an alchemist. The failure brought a massive explosion, and the accompanying earthquake destroyed many parts of Magatia. The Magic Pentagram that was destroyed then has made Homun in rage ever since. To make matters worse, the alchemist responsible for this seems to have gone missing..." />

            <string name="1" value="This might keep you busy, but...I want you to enter the Alcadno lab and get this document for me. Don't look at me like that! I actually really am curious to know one thing... The record regarding #bThat Incident#k... I think only Alcadnos have it, so... what do you think? Will you do it for me? Surely you're as curious as I am!" />

                <string name="0" value="...Really? You're going to do it? I wasn't really expecting you to say yes, but... this is great. Then... I suggest you make your way to #b#m261020700# of Alcadno#k. At this time, there should be no one inside the lab, and the lights should be out. You need to carefully get there through portals, okay? Once you get there, you'll need to search through the dark lab until you find the #bSecret Document#k." />
                <string name="1" value="If you bring the document, then I'll give you some information on #bThat Incident#k. People seem to want to keep it a hush hush, but... since you're in Magatia, as a proud member of Zenumist... I think you have the right to know what happened." />

                <string name="0" value="What's #bThat Incident#k? Well, I don't think the president of our society wants to discuss this. He knows what happened, and yet he wants to keep it a secret... but I disagree. I believe that all alchemists of Magatia have a right to know the truth... the truth about That Incident..." />
                <string name="1" value="It was a catastrophe unlike any other, and that all came from a foolish experiment conducted by an alchemist. As there are numerous experiments conducted at the same time, the alchemists are used to seeing their experiments fail. No failure, however, had affected the whole town of Magatia... not until then." />
                <string name="2" value="A few years ago, an alchemist from Alcadno made an error in the experiment. As a result, a huge explosion occurred, which brought an earthquake to all of Magatia... After the earthquake, the Magic Pentagram that had been existing in Magatia for the longest time started not working properly. That was the worst that could happen to this town..." />
                <string name="3" value="No one knows what the experiment was about... actually the president might know, yet he doesn't mention it once. Why...? The only thing we know is that the one person that knows everything about this, #bthe alchemist responsible for this incident, is missing.#k..." />
