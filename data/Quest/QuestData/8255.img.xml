        <string name="2" value="Adonis and I had an enlightening conversation about Zakum, and the residents of the former town. It appears that Zakum gains additional power from what Adonis calls &quot;Zakum Diamonds&quot;.  They are souls of those who fell in battle against the mighty Zakum.  As they were fellow warriors and adventurers like me, their souls must be released.  If I can find a relic of the old town, such as a Crystal Blade, Miner's Hat, El Nathian Cape or Cloak of Corruption and combine it with a Zakum Diamond, I can perform a 'Liberation Ritual&quot; that will free the soul by transferring their power into that item.  I can then wear the enchanted item for extra strength in battle!  Only thing is, Zakum Diamonds only come from one place, Zakum himself.  This won't be easy..." />
