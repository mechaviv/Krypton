            <string name="1" value=" A fresh fisherman dish is consumed by the fisherman at the harbor after a long day's work at sea, and it tastes delicious. How delicious? Take the best meal you've had, and double the helping. Fantastic, right? Of course, they'd cook up something they caught during the day. They're so fresh, they can't help but be vibrantly bouncing around before being cooked." />
            <string name="2" value="It's supposed to be just for them, but it seems like there's a restaurant out there that sells this kind of food these days, so... what should I call this ... a gourmet dish that's in touch with nature? THAT'S IT!" />

All you need to do is find #b#t04000153##k.\r\nApparently, it enables them to breathe underwater, with their eyes wide open, feasting on #b#o4230200##k. I hear that \r\n#b#o3210450##k the penguin has #b#t04000153##k, so please bring it to me!" />
