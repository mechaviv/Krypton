        <string name="2" value="Told #p2020006# about #p2020007#'s story of the #o8220001#. #p2020006# says it can't be true, because #o8220001# attacked him first and got mad over the entire thing. Strange that his story is different from what I heard from #p2020007#. Who speaks the truth? Or perhaps there's another story behind this? Let's get back to #p2020007#." />

            <string name="2" value="The Snowman had the heart of a human, but the looks of a monster, so people neglected him. The snow spirit was sorry for the Snowman, and froze a whole mountain range for him. \r\n#b#L0#A whole mountain range? Then you must be saying...?#l" />
            <string name="3" value="That's right. The mountain range the snow spirit froze for Snowman is El Nath Mountain Range. Soon after, the Snowman disappeared deep into the mountain. The Snowman hates to be seen by humans.\r\n#b#L0#Is the legend true?#l" />
            <string name="4" value="Well...a legend is just a legend, and we cannot tell its authenticity. Since the Snowman is a shy and gentle creature, you don't need to be worried even if you get to run into it. You may repeat this to Jade." />
