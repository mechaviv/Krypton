        <string name="1" value="I met up with Green Meoranger again at the Boswell Field of Omega Sector. As a last task, Green Mesoranger asked me to eliminate the #bPlateons#k again, and collect #bMecateon's#k weapons, which are very high-quality. I need to take out #b150 Plateons#k and collect #b120 Mecateon's Laser Guns#k for him.\n\n#o4230120# #r#a34371##k\n#t4000122# #b#c4000122##k/120" />
        <string name="2" value="Just the way the mission stated by Green Mesoranger of Boswell Field, I took out the Plateons and collected Mecateon's laser guns. Green Mesoranger seemed genuinely surprised by the fact that I took care of all the missions, and told me it'd be a pleasure to work with me again. Now, THAT felt good!" />
