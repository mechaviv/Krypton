        <string name="1" value="#p2140000# scratched his head and said he didn't know what happened this time.  He said unless I lost my Oblivion, which doesn't make sense, there should be no reason I can't pass through the Road to Oblivion. \n\nHe suggested that maybe the #bGoddess' Promise#k has been broken and told me to go see  #b#p2140003##k to check the records of the promise." />
        <string name="2" value="I met with #p2140003#.  He said he was waiting for me and began explaining things to me as if he already knew what happened.  He said that the blessing of the Goddess of Time, will never disappear or be taken away, and it was still valid... However, he said that there is another reason why I can't go deep into the temple." />

You can go there, but the way is blocked.  You don't think my oblivion was burnt by #o8220006# flames, do you?" />
            <string name="1" value="An oblivion isn't a piece of paper or something that can catch fire.  That's strange.  You passed the test and got your permissions, there isn't anything that should be stopping you... What do we do here... \r\n#L0# #bIs there a solution?  " />
            <string name="2" value="Your other problems were expected.  But, this is different.  An oblivion never disappears.  If it were to disappear that could only mean that the #bGoddess' promise#k had been broken...That can't be.... \r\n#L0# #b(The Goddess' promise?)" />
            <string name="3" value="There's no reason to believe that yet, but we should check just in case.  Go visit #b#p2140003##k and ask what happened to the Goddess' promise.  He is the Record Keeper of everything, so he is the only one who would be able to tell you." />
