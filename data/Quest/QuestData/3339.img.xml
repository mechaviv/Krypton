        <string name="1" value="When I told #p2111004# of my intentions to investigate more on #p2111002#, she contended that she'd rather prefer me conducting this as opposed to people from Alcadno or Zenumist. She then proceeded to tell me something that no one is aware of: #p2111002#'s #bunderground study#k. It may have been gathering dust from no one visiting, but I may be able to find a clue or two there..." />
        <string name="2" value="At #p2111002#'s underground study, I was able to locate a strange book. Maybe this book contains Dr. De Lang's Secret Notes! A hole that's found in the middle of the book looks like if I find the right item, it may fit perfect in the hole... if the key to the Secret Notes is made out of silver, as mentioned by the Wandering Alchemist, then maybe #b#t4031744##k is the key." />
