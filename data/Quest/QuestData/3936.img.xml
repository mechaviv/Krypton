        <string name="1" value="#p2101002# told me the key to being a Sand Bandit is hating the vile deeds of the queen, but not letting it show, and instead biding your time for the right moment to strike. Patience, in other words. Patience, a trait also needed when refining ores. So Eleska requested that you make #b2 #t4011008#s#k.   \n\n#i4011008# #t4011008#  #b#c4011008#/2" />
        <string name="2" value="After receiving the #t4011008#s, #p2101002# told you that you had enough patience to be a Sand Bandit. Now you just have to pass the tests of the other members. Hmm, the wall also mentioned a bow and an iron hammer." />

If you bring me #b2 #t4011008#s#k, then I'll personally accept you as a member of the Sand Bandits. It's not easy refining small ores into jewels, so... I think this will be a good test to gauge your patience." />
