        <string name="0" value="Keol and Ramain have been concerned lately because Moren seemed to be letting out a heavy sigh every other minute. They may not try to show it, but the two are struggling right now, so for the sake of these three, I better ask Moren what's up." />
        <string name="1" value="Gordon's Secret Technique! This is something I didn't even see coming. A secret technique that even the creator of the Maker skill cannot pray away. Moren had high expectations that this technique would further advance the Maker skill. I decided to visit Gordon in El Nath without notifying Moren. Who knows, I might be the one learning that skill instead." />
        <string name="2" value="After calmly answering Gordon's questions, I was able to have this rolling in no time. Gordon at first seemed taken aback that the very existence of the technique had been exposed, but seemed to have gotten over it quickly. He then made a proposition where if I pass his test, then he'll share his technique with me. I wonder what that test is..." />

            <string name="3" value="That's right, but he's not just another shoemaker! I got to see him work on his craft, and I was humbled and inspired by his work! He's a friend of mine, and a mentor as well!\r\n#b#L0#So what does that have to do with your heavy sighing?#l" />
            <string name="4" value="He has this technique that only he can duplicate! I tried as hard as I could, but I couldn't make it the way he did! That's why the other day, I wrote a letter to him asking for his secret technique... but he rejected my plea!!! \r\n#b#L0#I thought you just told me you were friends with Gordon!#l" />
            <string name="5" value="Gordon is a kind of a person who distinguishes personal life and work! He will not divulge his secrets even if you're his best friend! I was thinking of ways to improve the methods for the Makers, and I kept going back to Gordon's secret method, but... #h0#! Even if you meet Gordon after this, promise me not to tell him what I have just told you! He thinks I have completely given up on learning his secret method... sigh..." />

(in a faint voice) a...(doll?) two...(of them???)...maybe you had two... dolls...?\r\n#b#L1#Hmmm... (in a confident manner) Did you have a doll with you? At least two or three of them? Something that looked like... Pinocchio...?#l" />

Well, it's not something that you should know anyway, so don't worry about it." />
