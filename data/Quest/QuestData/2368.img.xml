I do know that the former Dark Lord was good friends with Tristan. In fact, Tristan came to Kerning City once in order to meet the former Dark Lord. Why don't you try talking to #bManji in Perion#k? He is close to Tristan, so he might also be able to shed some light on the former Dark Lord." />

Knowing the gravity of the task before us, we decided to request aid from the former Dark Lord. We were to convene before the battle, but unfortunately, we were delayed in our passage through the Burnt Lands, as the Boars in the area had become more violent. Upon our arrival at the Cursed Sanctuary, we discovered that the Dark Lord had died...with a boy covered in blood standing next to the body. He held a sword in one hand. That is all that I know..." />

Since then, I have not heard a thing about the boy or the former Dark Lord. Tristan is remembered for sacrificing his life to seal Balrog, and here I am... I've told you all that I know. Now go. I am feeling tired..." />
