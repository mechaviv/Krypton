        <string name="1" value="To help Little Suzy decide between Maplemas and Versalmas, I spoke to O-Pongo about Suzy's dilemma.  O-Pongo listened and asked me to deliver a message to Suzy.  I should talk to her in a bit.  " />
        <string name="2" value="Versal Power! I spoke with O-Pongo, the Versalmas Mouse, who is the &quot;Santa&quot; for the Versal version of Maplemas, and learned a great deal about Versalmas.  He told me about the customs for their holiday--quite different from the Maple World! The world of Versal is usually shrouded in darkness; Versalmas is an annual holiday that celebrates the emergence of the sun in their world, which shines for 90 straight days and only for these 90 days.  For Versalmas, children receive presents every day for the first 30 days, and get cool treats like Sugar-coated Olives and Caramel Onions! Sounds pretty awesome... Now I'd better speak with Maple Claws and head back to Suzy... It makes me wonder for myself though, which holiday would I pick to celebrate?  Hmmm..." />

            <string name="0" value="Hoy there, young friend!  My, my, what a beautiful world you live in!  Who am I?  Why, I am O-Pongo!  Nice to meet you!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Nice to meet you too, er, O-Pongo.  So what are you doing here in NLC?#l#k" />
            <string name="1" value="I'm here because it's that time of year!  It's Versalmas time again!  I'm the Versalmas Mouse so I'm here to spread Versalmas cheer!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Versalmas?  What's that?#l#k" />
            <string name="2" value="Why, Versalmas is the most wonderful holiday in all of Versal!  How wonderful?  Why, so wonderful that everyone loves Versalmas!  Versalmas is even better than birthdays!  Why, just imagine the best birthday you've ever had... and Versalmas is a hundred times better than that!  It's the most celebrated holiday in Versal!  Well... it's actually the only holiday celebrated in Versal.  But it's still wonderful, nonetheless!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Um, so why are you here?  Shouldn't you be in Versal for that?#l#k" />
            <string name="3" value="As for why I'm here, it's a strange story.  As the Versalmas Mouse, I'm bound by Versalmas law to deliver a present to every Versalian, no matter how far and wide they are located in Versal.  Whew, it's no easy task I tell you!  I had crossed off everyone on my list except for one last name -- Elpam Gorlab!\r\nI had Elpam's gift all ready to go, but I couldn't find him anywhere!  So, I asked my trusty steed, Pwnzer, to &quot;sniff&quot; out where he was, and take me to him, crackity-splat!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Er, I'm guessing Pwnzer is a reindeer?#l#k" />
            <string name="4" value="Reindeer?  What's that?  No, Pwnzer is an ostrich, of course!  He would be offended if you thought of him as anything but!  Anyway, I yelled &quot;To Elpam Gorlab, Pwnzer, and away!&quot; and lo and behold --POOF!-- I arrived beside Elpam, here by this strange tower, in a completely different world!\r\nIn my shock at arriving here -- and to see one our most esteemed Versalians here in a strange new world on Versalmas! -- I almost forgot to give him his present!  Hoy, that would have been a first -- an undelivered gift!  Elpam was just as surprised to see me here -- why, he almost fell down from his perch on that metal tower!  &lt;chuckles&gt; It was a pleasant surprise though, I assume!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#I'm sure...#l#k" />
            <string name="5" value="After giving Elpam his gift, which he was happy to receive, I asked him for more information about where &quot;here&quot; was. He told me that this place is called the &quot;Maple World,&quot; a place I had only heard about in Versalian legend!  In these tales, it's said that the sun shines in this world everyday!  When Elpam told me that this was actually true, I almost fell over!  And you can imagine how hard that would be to do given my size! &lt;chuckles&gt; I never thought the legends to be true!\r\nEven now, I can hardly believe it!  The welcome sight of an eternal sun swells my chest with happiness! At first, I was at a lost to be in a different world, but I've realized that this also makes the Maple World a perfect place for Versalmas!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#A perfect place for Versalmas?  Um... why is that?#l#k" />
            <string name="6" value="Because Versalmas is a celebration of the Sun!  You see, in Versal, it is perpetually dark... I believe that you have &quot;night&quot; here as well.  Well, it is night all the time in Versal.  But once a year, our sun comes back... for 30 glorious days straight, which we call the &quot;30 Days of Delight&quot;!  Versalmas Day is the first of these days, and each day after, while the sun shines, we celebrate Versalmas.  Each day of Versalmas, everyone, not just the young, receive gifts from their loved ones. So you see, because the sun shines here in the Maple World every day, why then... it's Versalmas here every day!  Hooray!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Well the gift-giving part sounds a bit like our Maplemas.  Er, have you heard about Maplemas?#l#k" />
            <string name="7" value="That is what everyone I've met has been telling me!  It does seem that your Maplemas is very similar to our Versalmas.  This is quite exciting to me!  Perhaps we can exchange customs and gifts!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#What are the differences?  Do you have different foods and traditions for Versalmas?#l#k\r\n#b#L1#That seems to be the problem.  Do you remember a girl named Suzy?  She asked me to speak with you.#l#k" />
            <string name="8" value="Ah, I remember speaking with that lovely little child earlier in my walk through this wonderful city--just after I delivered Elpam's gift. She told me about how she loved candy canes, and I told her in turn about our #bSugar-coated Olives#k, which are simply delicious! She seemed very excited about new types of presents and told me all about her #bWishlist#k. My, my, that girl certainly wants quite a few specific things!\r\nSo you say that she needs help to determine whether she should celebrate Versalmas this year?  Hoy, then... would you be kind enough to convey a message to her from me?" />

                    <string name="0" value="Food, indeed!  Of course!  What is a holiday without food?  Food is one of the hallmarks of Versalmas tradition, and personally my favorite part!\r\n Whereas you people here enjoy what you call your &quot;#bMaplemas Ham#k,&quot; we have #bSmoked Salmon#k for our traditional dinner, which sounds much more delicious to me!  I hope you get the chance to try some!  And perhaps I will try your ham as well!  There are also a host of other traditional holiday dishes, such as those tasty #bCaramel Onions#k and my favorite, #bSugar-coated Olives#k!  I am happy to say that I have a bag full of these with me which I would be happy to share! The most popular Versalmas gifts are gifts of food!\r\nI have also heard that you decorate a tree with lights and ornamentation.  We do the same!  Only we decorate a #bCactus#k instead.  We Versalians sing many of our songs of praise to the sun as we dance around our #bVersalmas Cactus#k!  And... er, you may have noticed that Versalians are somewhat pale.  Because we're no longer used to the bright sunlight, #bSunblock#k is a popular and useful gift for this holiday as well!\r\nIt is so strange how we are from different worlds yet we have similar customs!" />

If Maplemas is like Versalmas, then we both believe in the gift of sharing.  I do believe that even in your world, used to the traditions of Maplemas, there is room for Versalmas as well.\r\nThank you for giving her my message.  I certainly hope Suzy -- and you! -- choose to celebrate Versalmas with me this year!  Happy Versalmas to you, and may your days be bright!" />
