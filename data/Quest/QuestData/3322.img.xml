        <string name="1" value="When I asked #p2111004# of #p2111002#, she seemed to be on the defensive. She couldn't believe I actually talked to #p2111002#. In order to make #p2111004# believe in me, I better provide solid evidence... maybe I should find the #bpendant#k that #p2111002# wanted to give her." />
        <string name="2" value="After seeing the pendant, #p2111004# finally accepted the fact that I met with #p2111002#. She seemed distrustful of both Zenumist and Alcadno. According to her, #p2111002#'s experiment touched a nerve with an important secret of #m261000000#, and the presidents of both societies had been more than eager to keep #p2111002#'s work and the accident quiet." />

Since everyone's staying mum about the whole subject, other alchemists began speculating about De Lang, and the more they speculate, the worse his image got.
