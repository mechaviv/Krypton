        <string name="1" value="I ran into Olson the Toy Soldier at the 100th floor on Eos Tower, doing his job as the security guard next to Delv. Olson told me a story of a monster sneaking in through the cracks of time and stealing a pendulum from the clocktower, culminating with the monster disguising itself as a dollhouse somewhere inside. I need to locate the one that's different from the sea of dollhouses in here. " />
        <string name="2" value="Inside the secret room of Eos Tower, I located the monster disguised as a dollhouse, destroyed it, recovered the pendulum, and gave it to Mark the Toy Soldier. This should get the Ludibrium Clocktower to start working again." />
