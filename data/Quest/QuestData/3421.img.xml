If I take care of this mission, I'll probably gain some more of her trust... \n\n#t4031117# #b#c4031117##k/6" />

Apparently, the aliens, while making their way here, landed hard, to the point of having quite a number of asteroids dropping around Omega Sector. My boss said that by collecting samples, it'll immensely help our level of science in Omega Sector." />
