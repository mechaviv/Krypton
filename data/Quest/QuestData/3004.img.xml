            <string name="0" value="Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Alcaster the Sorcerer, studying the intricate details of magic and wizardry for over 300 years here. Say, I haven't seen someone with a piercing, affirming look in the eyes like you have in a while. I feel safe asking someone like you for help. What do you think? I am sure you may be busy with your other endeavors, but can you make some time and listen to my story?" />
            <string name="1" value="Recently I found something very interesting from an old book that I was looking at while studying forbidden magic. The book states that somewhere around Ossyria, an incredible book by the name of #b#t4031056##k is hidden away. It was used ages ago at a war but its whereabouts have been questionable at best since. At least the very existence of the book is recorded for us to wonder..." />
            <string name="2" value="I'd like to have that book with me and study it. I'm sure once it's discovered the book will be full of important, previously-unknown knowledge on spells. Too bad I'm very old and in need of more research here so I won't be able to find it myself. I'm sorry, but can you find #b#t4031056##k for me? I know it won't be easy, but I can at least help you out a little bit." />

                <string name="0" value="Thank you! But it will be impossible for you to locate the book without any information on its whereabouts. According to this book, a descendant of the author of #b#t4031056##k resides in Orbis. That person may have a clue or two on #b#t4031056##k's whereabouts. I'll be waiting for you to come back with good news. Good luck." />
