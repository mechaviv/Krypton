        <string name="1" value="#p2020005# said that because of #p2111002#'s experiment, the Black Magician's Magic Pentagram that sustained #m261000000# was shaken to its core, which unstabilized the Pentagram. He also mentioned that if this is kept as it is, then soon, the Magic Pentagram will explode. In order to prevent this from happeninng, he instructed me to find #b3 Magic Rocks and place them in sequence to soothe the Magic Pentagram, then apply pressure to the center of the Magic Pentagram#k... \n\n#i4031739##t4031739# #b#c4031739##k/1 \n#i4031740##t4031740# #b#c4031740##k/1 \n#i4031741##t4031741# #b#c4031741##k/1\n\nI received one of the Magic Rocks from #p2020005#, but the rest will have to be found through the #rmonsters of #m261000000##k. I better find 3, and then head off to the Black Magician's Lab. That lab is only accessible through the secret passage that connects Zenumist and Alcadno." />

            <string name="1" value="Yes I will... but before that, I want to clarify something first. As written on the note, did #p2111002# wind up conducting the experiment? \r\n#b#L0# Yes, he did.#l" />
            <string name="2" value="...Sigh. In that case, I have no choice but to give you some of the burden in regards to this event. The experiments conducted by #p2111002# were too risky and reckless, to say the least. He may have believed in the power of the Black Magician, but... the Magic Pentagram he made was made hundreds of years ago. It's probably already weakened considerably since then. \r\n#b#L0# That means...#l" />
            <string name="3" value="If #p2111002#'s experiment is the cause for the epic explosion,  then I am sure the Black Magician's Magic Pentagram is destroyed as well. The fact that the Magic Pentagram served as the foundation of #m261000000#, and if that's destroyed... you get the picture. I suspect that after #p2111002#'s failure, #m261000000# itself might have been negatively affected. Isn't that so? \r\n#b#L0# I heard that was the case.#l" />
            <string name="4" value="...I knew it. In that case... I may need to give you more responsibilities on this matter. Can you do something important for the town of #m261000000#? The town that is polluted with lies and deceit?&#x9;" />
