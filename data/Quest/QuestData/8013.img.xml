Anyway, can I help you? Wow...this... this is THE Zakum Armor! Hey, this... doesn't seem very powerful though. What? The armor got weakened after loosening up the spell? Hahaha... I can fix that, but once I invigorate the dormant force, the level of the equipment shall also rise accordingly. Are you sure you want to do it? " />

I will pray during that period to assist you.  If you fall down during the attack, then you'll have to return to the spot of origin. By the way, this'll cost you 60,000 mesos.

The cost of using the facility will be 50,000 mesos, and 10,000 mesos for other security expenses, so that's the bottom line. What do you think? If you want to take a crack at it, then bring me 60,000 mesos. Then, and only then, will I take you to the forest where the beautiful lady sleeps." />
