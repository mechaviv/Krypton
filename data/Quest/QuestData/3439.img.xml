        <string name="1" value="I met General Maestro, who's in command of a humongous army at the Omega Sector. The general said after investigating the dull crystals from the Drum Bunnies, he realized that the aliens may have a clue about this, and instructed me to find Alien Gray. There may be an item around Alien Gray that may provide clues for this. Of course, it won't just cough up the item, so I may have to look around the area where it's at. \n\n#t4031136# #c4031136#/1" />
        <string name="2" value="Just like the way General Mastro instructed, I found a hidden document that appeared to have been purposely hidden Alien Gray. The general said, after putting the document through Alien Language Translator, it said a Dark Cryastal Ore with its dark force will turn a harmless doll into a monster. He wanted all the crystals gone before it gets too late." />

            <string name="0" value="You're back. I've been wrestling with the #b#t4031135##k that you gave me. There was something in it that I found interesting... based on what I see, it looks like the aliens that are near Omega Sector may be carrying a clue or two. What do you think... would you like to help me out one more time?" />
            <imgdir name="yes">
                <string name="0" value="Great decision. I have a feeling that one of the aliens may have a clue on the secrets of #t4031135#. I found out that a while ago, they were conducting the same studies as I was. All signs point to an alien called #b#p2050002##k, but it's not like he's going to spill out the information that easily." />
                <string name="1" value="You'll find #b#p2050002##k right outside the Omega Sector. I just received news from my assistant that he may have documented the secrets of #t4031135#. Please go there in place of me and snoop around the area for some clues. Good luck." />

            <string name="0" value="For you to find it this early, you may be much more than I thought. Hoh... #b#t4031136##k... it looks like he wrote it in a hurry. It may be written in alien language, but if he thought I could never translate this, he may be in for a big surprise. Hahaha... anyway, please take this. It's my way of saying thanks." />
            <imgdir name="yes">
                <string name="0" value="Alright... I better put this document in the Alien Language Translator. This translator has got to be the pride and joy of the Omega Sector, a pinnacle of its technological achievement. Hmmm... this was written in a hurried, scribbly way so it may not be able to translate 100% accurately, but it say that the gist of it has been translated. Let's see... oh ho... I knew it." />
                <string name="1" value="According to the document, a regular doll will turn into a monster if in possession of the Dark Crystal Ore, a crystal laden with the force of evil. The #t4031135#s that you brought are just shells of its original state, with the force of evil having already escaped." />
                <string name="2" value="If that's the case, then the majority of the dolls that have turned into monsters have been attacking humans because of that Dark Crystal, laden with the force of evil. Now that the aliens have a hold of this information, you never know what kind of sinister plans they may be thinking of. We have to hurry, because this town may be in danger!" />
                <string name="3" value="I can't thank you enough for helping me out one more time. Now's my turn to figure out a way to solve this. Oh, and... please keep this a secret. It's not too late to release this information only after all the studies conclude and the final results are in." />

There's a report that he has #t4031135#'s secrets on document, so your job is to snoop around him, and find something that may provide a clue or two, then bring that item to me. Please be careful not to get caught. Good luck." />
