            <string name="0" value="Hmmm... wait, this is...!! Wow... interesting... it's definitely worth studying. Hey, you look like a traveler... have you ever been to Eos Tower? If so, then you may have met a monster that resembles an Octopus, #o3230302#. A monster called #b#o3230302##k, isn't it strange?" />
            <string name="1" value="What do I mean by this? Well, the way #o3230302# is structured, it really looks familiar...and after some researching, I have come to conclusion that it may be close to that of the aliens. Maybe #o3230302# is made by the aliens. It's defeintely worth more attention. Can you help me on this?" />

                <string name="0" value="The physical structure of the aliens are well-known in Omega Sector, so I know a thing or two about, but they can't be necessarily called #o3230302#. That's why I want you to go get #b1 #t4000099##k, which is based on #o3230302#. Once you get that, we can determine the similarities between the Blocktopus and the Omega Sector aliens." />
                <string name="1" value="But you know... there's gotta be a better method to research something like #t4000099#. Something like a #bManual#k... but it's really hard to get, so just disregard what I just said." />
