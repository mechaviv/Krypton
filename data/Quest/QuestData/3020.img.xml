Don't try to wrestle it away from me, because I've been fighting monsters for a long long time and you can't even come close to beating me. If you really want it back, however, we can make a deal. Don't worry, I won't ask you to do anything ridiculous. What do you think ... do we have ourselves a deal?" />
            <string name="1" value="Alright, the deal is simple. Recently the price on the wolf skin has skyrocketed, but it's been tough hunting them since it's that time of the year where they get very aggressive. If you get me #b80 #t4000051#s and 80 #t4000052#s#k, I'll return the ring AND tell you everything I know about it. Don't make me wait too long. Get me those ASAP!" />

I don't really need it now. Before that, though, check and see if you have any room on your use inventory." />
