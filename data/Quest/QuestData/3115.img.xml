        <string name="1" value="#p2012012# told me she saw a fish that resembled a huge chunk of metal crossing the water, and wanted me to find out exactly what that creature is. It was heading towards #b#m100030000##k, so I better go there right now." />
        <string name="2" value="There's a huge wooden entryway leading into #m100030000# which I'd never seen before. It almost looks like an entryway to a fortress... I should try talking to #p1094000#, who was standing in front of me. I remember him telling me that a #bpirate #p1072008##k fort is being built here.  But for what purpose?" />

            <string name="0" value="Just a few minutes ago, while flying over the ocean, I saw this #bweird creature#k around the area. It was the size of a town! Its body looked like blackened, solid steel, yet it was able to move on top of the water and underneath it with equal prowess." />
            <string name="1" value="It really felt threatening, so I decided to chase this thing from behind, and wouldn't you know it, it was heading towards Victoria Island! Wait a minute... is this... a new monster getting ready to attack #m100000000#? This is really troubling." />

Wait, this is not it. What are you trying to do there? Whatever you are trying to do, it won't fool me! Not #p1094000#!" />

We use Knucklers and Guns to make sure that the root of all evil is vanquished--we want to make sure that the Black Magician never rises to the heights of power as he did before." />
            <string name="3" value="Just like the wisemen in Victoria Island training for the day the Black Magician returns, #p1072008# is busy making sure that his followers stay in low numbers.  She's so young, too. That's just so admirable!" />

We're not aliens or anything like that! We're just Pirates.  Fearsome, fight-to-the-last-man, potion-loving Pirates! Don't tell me you are thinking of Lord Pirate and those despicable bandits.

If you want to join us and #p1072008# and become a mighty  #bGunslinger or Brawler#k, come back later. By then, we'll be ready to accept you with open arms, and train you to live the life of a Pirate!" />
