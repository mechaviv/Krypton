        <string name="2" value="Icebyrd has revealed the truth to me at last-he was contacted by Subani to establish New Leaf City as well as anchor Masteria to the Maple World.  He was sworn to secrecy, and to this day, can never leave the continent.  It appears that Subani and Icebyrd are the first line of defense against the demonic Naricain, and by defeating his Twisted Masters; I am now his enemy as well.  He also mentioned that our adventures here have just begun...with the Twisted Masters out of the way, what's next?  Perhaps answers lie within the #bKrakian Jungle#k, and the mysterious city there...only time will tell!" />

Or are we merely doomed to repeat the actions of history? This question is what originally led me here...and I received an answer that led to my sacrifice in establishing New Leaf City.  I was sworn to secrecy until the truth could be revealed.  As you have proved yourself time and time again, you have earned my trust as well as someone else's.  I will tell you why I established New Leaf City." />

The one condition was that I could never leave the continent.  Ever.  I agreed without hesitation." />

            <string name="0" value="I remember way back, when I still lived in Kerning City; I had a dream...or perhaps a nightmare.  I saw everything working in a twisted sense of order, everyone in the Maple World had a vacant look upon their face, and the sky itself had turned black.  I saw a terrifying beast, large, powerful, with endless arms.  I saw pure misery - nothing could match its strength.  It had taken over the Maple World.  I remember seeing my friends as slaves to this horrible beast, and I remember the voice which told me I could stop it." />
            <string name="1" value="The next thing I knew, I stood in this very spot.  Subani helped me construct the city, the spirit's light growing dimmer with each task of strength.  Finally, when the city was finished, Subani told me that I could not tell a soul of what I knew, until the time was right. I had to let things happen as if I knew nothing.  Then, Subani was gone...vowing to return when most needed.  To see you standing here before me proves that you have the strength, courage and honor to be a new hero of Masteria. The storm is still coming, but I like our chances with you around." />
