        <string name="1" value="Carson told me if I wanted to know more about the incident, then I'll have to prove him my worth, by entering the #bclosed-off lab#k where #rHomun#k is, and acquire the Magic Control Device and control the monsters through that.  Once I throw the device into the Pentagram of Alchemy in the lab, the monsters can be controlled in an instant, and then I'll need to bring back #b#t4031709##k as evidence...  \n\n#i4031709##t4031709# #b#c4031709##k/1" />

I do have, however, one thing... that concerns me a bit. I heard you have also been paying much attention to... something other than conducting experiments. \r\n#b#L0#What do you mean?#l" />
            <string name="1" value="I heard you asked about That Incident. The incident caused by a neglect of one alchemist that wound up affecting everyone in Magatia. It's not something I wanted to share with a newcomer like you, since it's nothing to boast about. Are you... interested in knowing more about that incident, though?\r\n#b#L0#Yes, but...#l" />
            <string name="2" value="I understand your interest in the incident, but I suggest you stay away from it from here on out. I don't think you have the right to know more about the incident. It is related to the darkness of the alchemists that reside here... it's something I don't feel you are equipped to handle.\r\n#b#L0#You never know.#l" />
            <string name="3" value="...You seem quite confident. I do remember #p2111008# mentioning how strong you are... Maybe you can find something new from the house of #r#p2111002##k. ..What do you think? I know this will not be an easy task, but can you search the house of the missing alchemist, #p2111002#? You will be rewarded well for this work." />
