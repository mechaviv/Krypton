        <string name="1" value="I got to see Scadur again, first time we really got to talk since the whole Book of Ancient fiasco. He told me a story of how, a long time ago, a bunch of monsters from the dead mine claimed the life of his wife, enraging his son Nick. 3 years later, he went into the dead mine, hoping to avenge his mother's death, but haven't been heard since. He wanted me to find #bNick's Ring#k somewhere at the innermost part of the lava cave. He also wants me to grant his dying wish, which would be collecting #b100 Cerebes' teeth#k. This will be VERY tough to do ..." />
        <string name="2" value="I went into the innermost part of the lava cave, where I found a chipped part of a statue. I have a feeling something is in here." />

Anyway, I have a distinct favor to ask you ... something I've been wishing to take care of for a long, long time. What do you think? It may not be easy, but do you want to help me nonetheless?" />

                <string name="1" value="Then one day, a group of monsters from the mines attacked our town. They took my wife Ria away from me forever ... and, ever since her passing, Nick had turned into a totally different person." />
                <string name="2" value="He made up his mind to strengthen himself so he can take care of the monsters from the mines. I tried my best to stop him, to no avail. He left 3 years ago to defeat the monsters, and I haven't heard one word from him since. It's obvious what happened to him ..." />
