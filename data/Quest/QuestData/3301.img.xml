            <string name="1" value="Yes, which makes life harder for travelers like you. People are in so much conflict between one another that it's hard to join either of the two forces.

            <string name="3" value="Hahaha... I knew you would Say that. An adventurer like you would never reject an opportunity like this. I have to warn you, though, that joining the Zenumist sect is not easy. They believe that they are the true scholars, and they treat themselves as an exclusive bunch. In order to join Zenumist, you'll need to present to them your work as an alchemist. \r\n#b#L0#Does that mean it's impossible?#l" />
