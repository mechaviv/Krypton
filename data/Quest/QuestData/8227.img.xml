        <string name="1" value="Jack needs John's help, and needs me to be the go-between.  He wants me to deliver a letter to his brother in NLC; the #bCoded Communique#k contains a transcription of some strange symbol code that he saw while being held in Crimsonwood Keep.  Hopefully, with his expertise in ancient languages, John should be able to decipher it.  I should hop to it!  I have a feeling some serious events are unfolding..." />
        <string name="2" value="Looks like Jack was right about the symbols he saw in the Grandmaster Council Hall; the Versalian code seems to indicate that the new Masters are planning to attack NLC with the soldiers they're training!  It's going to be up to us to stop them!" />
