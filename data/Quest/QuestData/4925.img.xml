Perhaps I should visit him in New Leaf City and see what he wants with it.  Maybe he'll reward me for bringing him some..." />
        <string name="1" value="I visited the Glimmer Man, and discovered that he's an ultra-powerful mage whose ability to turn his entire body into pure diamond (hence his name) has allowed him to journey to space and other inhospitable environments.  Through the vast knowledge he's acquired during his explorations, he's also become somewhat of a renowned weapons creator and arms dealer.\r\nThe Glimmer Man has landed in Masteria looking for something called #b#t4031760##k, a rare element from the alternate dimension of Versal he's been dying to experiment with.  To thank me for recovering some and bringing it to him, he's promised to make me a weapon of my own from it. However, I've got to also track down #b7 #t4021008#s#k and return these to him as well.  Only then can he reduce the naturally unstable Materia down to a useable form.  A weapon made from an otherwordly material! I wonder what it does..." />
        <string name="2" value="I returned to the Glimmer Man and he synthesized the #b#t4031760##k and the #b7 #t4021008#s#k I gave him to form a Materia Orb.  He's said his precocious friend Spindle can turn this into a weapon, so I should see him when I'm ready to make the weapon...WOOT!  Spindle is currently residing in the Omega Sector.  Additionally, anytime I find more White Versal Materia, I can bring it to the Glimmer Man and he'll create another Materia Orb for me so I can make another weapon!" />
