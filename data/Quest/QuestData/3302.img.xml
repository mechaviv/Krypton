He then told me to take it to #bZenumist Society#k, and place it next to the blue alchemy pillar, which will automatically create the item for me. He then told me to give it to #b#p2111000##k... is the broker really telling the truth?  Seems impossible..." />
        <string name="2" value="When I left #t4031705# next to the alchemy pillar, I heard a deafening explosion, followed by the creation of a useless tree branch. I had no idea what that was, but I gave it to #p2111000#. He seemed VERY satisfied with the result, and gave me #b#t1102135##k in return.  Why would he want a tree branch?" />

Just making the pillar react to your alchemy, however, is not enough. Your work itself was great, but no one knows the end result of this, right?" />

You shall never stray away from that, like the Alcadnos. If you partake in their questionable methods, then you may end up losing what power you may have right now." />
                <string name="2" value="Anyway, you are now officially a Zenumist. Please wear the cape wherever you go. Without it, no one will recognize you as a Zenumist, so don't ever lose it. It's the cape that ultimately differentiates Zenumist from Alcadno.  Along with our sense of humor. Ha." />
                <string name="3" value="Keep this in mind. If you want to engage in serious conversations with other Zenumists, you MUST wear the cape. #bWear it#k, not just carry it around in your inventory." />
