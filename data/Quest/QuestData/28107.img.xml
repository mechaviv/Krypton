            <string name="0" value="Hello, Maplers! I am part of a band of heros, sworn to protect the Maple World from outside threats.  There are only a few of us, but we've stopped countless plots in the shadows...until now.  I arrived to tell you about a madman known as &quot;Mal Volance&quot;, or for short,&quot;MV&quot;.  He used to be a part of our group, and was a fine hero,  but he has betrayed us, and seeks to cause anarchy rather than order.  We're not sure how it happened, he seems to be under the influence of some strange, even demonic force.  He conspires to attack the Maple World, only to cause  anarchy and chaos.  I'm positive that he's plotting something nefarious, and I need your help to stop him." />
            <string name="1" value="The thing is... I first need to test if you are ready to encounter him.  He's no pushover, after all.  As a simple test, you must search for the secret letters that contain information about &quot;MV&quot;. After completing the search of secret letters, you will obtain a #bMap to MV's Lair." />
