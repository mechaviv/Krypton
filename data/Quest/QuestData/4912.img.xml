He's got a passionate hatred for Wolf Spiders, as one bit her just as she was giving him a kiss. So, I've agreed to hunt down 100 Wolf Spiders in return for his thanks and something special he picked up. I should be able to find them in the MesoGears..." />
        <string name="2" value="+Phew* I wiped out 100 of those pesky Wolf Spiders, and in return, I received a Leaf Crystal from Jack Masque. I can come back every 72 hours to help him if I want. I wonder what he did to get kicked out of Amoria...?" />

I'm from Amoria, but that neither here nor there...it's a long story why I left...but since you're still here, I'll give you the short version. I'm in love! I am lost in the throes of passion with the most beautiful creature I have laid eyes upon...a Princess. Princess Restless to be exact. I'm competing for her with some snob-nosed prince. We were out on our first date, and the time was perfect. The sun was shining, birds were tweeting, and just as I was about to receive a kiss from her sweet lips, this strange spider attacked us! I fought the beast off, but that was a one in a million chance with her! I swore to wear this mask in shame until I could return to Amoria with honor. But I must hurry, that accursed Prince Vince is sure to attempt to steal her away...So, I want you to go and eliminate 100 Wolf Spiders, which should ensure that this never happens again. If you're successful, I have a particularly rare crystal that may suit you...get going!" />

Icebyrd offered me a chance to redeem myself, and I took it. I won't take off this mask until I can return to Amoria with honor! You've helped me and I never forget a favor. I may have a few tasks for you in the future. With your help, I'm sure that I'd get a leg up on that walking waste of space known as Prince Vince... Does this answer your question?" />
