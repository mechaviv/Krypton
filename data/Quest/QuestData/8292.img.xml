        <string name="0" value="Now that I have Little Suzy's Wishlist, I need to give it to either Maple Claws or O-Pongo.  I'm thinking I should give it to Maple Claws; I should go see her in Happyville." />
        <string name="1" value="I can give Little Suzy's Wishlist to Maple Claws.  In doing so, she'll be counting on me to help me recover her presents for her this year.  All I have to do now is to give Maple Claws the list to cement my decision. Yes... it's going to be a very Merry Maplemas this year!" />
        <string name="2" value="I thought that Maplemas was the better holiday so I gave #bLittle Suzy's Wishlist#k to Maple Claws.  In return, she gave me a red #bMaplemas Hat#k that I can wear proudly to show my Maplemas Spirit!  Every time I help Maple Claws recover the presents stolen by monsters, she'll reward me; I'll now be able to redeem presents with her in batches of #b10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, or 100#k.  I'll get different rewards at different tiers; the more presents I bring at one time, the better the rewards!  I'll need to bring her presents appropriate to my level though.\r\nBringing Maple Claws more presents will also help me earn #bMaplemas Spirit#k!  If the total amount of #bMaplemas Spirit#k accumulated on my world beats out the total amount of #bVersalmas Cheer#k, Maple Claws will have a special something for me at the end of the event!a" />

            <string name="1" value="Well, if you are making a decision for both you and her, then you should be doubly sure.  If you choose Maplemas, I will be counting on you to recover my stolen presents for me.  Once you've decided however, you'll be able to turn in #b30 presents or more to me at a time#k, for even better rewards!  Just a warning though, if you choose Maplemas as your holiday this year, I doubt O-Pongo will allow you to redeem presents with him anymore.\r\nThink on it, and return to me with #bLittle Suzy's Wishlist#k when you're sure that this is not just the right choice for Suzy, but also the right choice for you as well.  Okay?" />
