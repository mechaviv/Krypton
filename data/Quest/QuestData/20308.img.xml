Truth be told, Ereve had never faced a crisis like this before, so naturally, I have never had to provide so many copies of Investigation Permits to various Knights. Yes, I am short on supplies needed to make the Investigation Permit." />

The search needs to start right away, as well..." />

I know we don't have much time, but even the best Master of Disguise won't be able to escape Ereve that quickly, especially if the island is in code red as it is now. Once you bring me the item, I will go ahead and print you the Investigation Permit." />
