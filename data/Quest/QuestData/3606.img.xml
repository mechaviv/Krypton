Swallow was on a delivery, but lost the item that it was suppose to deliver: a rare seed, and Swallow wanted me to find the seed for it. Apparently, it dropped the seed somewhere around where a bunch of suspicious rabbits looked on. Maybe the rabbits took it...\n\n#t4031241# #b#c4031241##k/1" />
        <string name="2" value="I met Swallow near the village shrine, its wings clipped. Swallow was desperate to find the lost seed, and asked me for help. Swallow claimed to have lost the seed where a bunch of suspicious-looking rabbits gathered up, so I asked each and every one of them about the whereabouts of the seed. The seed was eventually found, and I gave them back to Swallow." />
