        <string name="1" value="I met Robinson in the middle of the island right at the center of the ocean, and he said that he used be a pilot for the army of Omega Sector, but while in a combat against the aliens, he ran away from the scene, only to be swept by strong currents that led you to where you were. He wishes to get back to the Omega Sector, but currently we have no idea where we are, and he's been covered with scars. As a result, he asked me if I can go to the Omega Sector, notify #b#p2051001##k of his troubles, and ask for some relief. Where is the Omega Sector?" />
        <string name="2" value="I went to see #b#p2051001##k at the Omega Sector, and handed him a card of Robinson's ID. He said everyone's been wondering of his whereabouts, and wanted me to describe the position of the island in detail." />

To further avoid the aliens, I dove into the ocean, not knowing I was about to be swept away by a huge tidal wave, and I lost conscious. By the time I woke up, I found myself here in this remote island, so I wrote a letter and float it on the water looking for help." />

I need to return to the Omega Sector immediately, but I have no idea where I am at, and I am considerably weaker than I was before. I can't even think of getting out of here by myself, so please go to the Omega Sector in place of me and notify them of my situation so they can send some people here to rescue me." />
