        <string name="1" value="When I gave Sophilia's favorite doll to Jonas, it seemed to have awaken him from his madness.  He's realized that his Toy Machine has been corrupted and is churned out twisted versions of his former creations.  Because the machine can't be destroyed, Jonas has asked me to destroy as many of his creations as possible.  For every 50 Psycho Jacks, 50 Nightmares, or 50 Sophilia Dolls I destroy, Jonas has promised to reward me with something special." />
        <string name="2" value="Jonas gave me all of his Toymaker Gear in return for helping him destroy his twisted creations.  He also gave me the key to his Toy Workshop, asking me to give it to someone who will help keep it safe and find a way to restore the Prendergast name." />

            <string name="0" value="You have done me a great service.  I have given you all of my toy-making equipment... but it is good, I have chosen to retire from this craft.  It is past my time here.  I wanted to give you one more thing... but it's no longer where I thought I'd placed it.  It was something I had made for Sophilia, for her 16th birthday.\r\n\r\n#L0##bIt's okay... I'm glad I could help.  But can you tell me more about Sophilia?#l" />
            <string name="1" value="She was my only daughter.  When Sophilia was born, I was but a simple carpenter.  Those were lean times, so I had to make toys for her by hand... but, just to see the light on her face!  &lt;smiles&gt; It was a simpler time, but Annabelia and I, and our young bundle of joy... the three of us, we were happy.\r\nAfter Annabelia passed away, I was completely devastated, but my darling Sophilia, she took care of her old Papa... and she was only a young child.  It is hard for a young girl to lose her mother, even though she did her best not to show it.  I threw myself into my work, trying to create toys to please her, distract her from our loss.  But in time, my toys gained in popularity, the company took off, so many things to take care of, new lines of toys to create... now it all seemed like it moved so quickly.  The years, they all pass by so quickly.  But I did it all for her... I did!  &lt;slumps&gt; In the end, perhaps all she really needed was her Dad to be there.  Please... I can't speak any more of her... it's too hard...\r\n\r\n#L0##bI am sorry for your loss, Jonas.  The rest of your household has been worried about you.#l" />
            <string name="2" value="They?  They are still here?  Edmunds... my loyal servant.  He has been with this family as long as this house has been standing.  He is still with me?  Yes?  He has been a good man to stay with me so long.  He has been a loyal friend.\r\nAnd Ludmilla?  &lt;sigh&gt; Ludmilla is Ludmilla.  The only one of my wives I ever truly loved was my Anna... after her, there was no other.  But Sophilia was a young girl, she needed a mother... and I tried to ensure that she had the best.  It shames me to admit, I was not always the best husband... nor the best father.\r\n\r\n#L0##bThat's what marriage is all about...#l" />
