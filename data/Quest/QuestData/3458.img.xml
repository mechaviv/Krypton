        <string name="0" value="#b#p2050009##k in #b#m221000000##k wants to share his new plans with someone.  " />
        <string name="1" value="#b#p2050009##k suggested that we help #b#p2050008##k.  He says we can prevent aliens from attacking by using solid #b#t04000101##k to build a defensive wall around #b#m221000000##k.  In order to find out if this plan is possible, we need to get #b#t04000101##k and get it tested by #b#p2050001##k.\n\n#i04000101##t04000101# #b#c04000101#/20\n\n#r30 minute time limit" />
        <string name="2" value="It's sad that #b#p2050009##k really thinks his idea is brilliant but #b#p2050001##k is right.  This plan clearly makes no sense and doesn't even need scientific testing in order to prove that...  Ugh, next time I should think things through before I offer to help.  I hope I grew at least a little bit." />

There are countless #r#o4230109##k around our base.  If we can construct a defensive wall by using these limitless #r#o4230109##k, #b#p2050008##k won't have to ever worry about alien attacks!" />

Oh, remember that he is a very busy person.  He is said be starting a very important research project in #r30 minutes#k, so you must go see him #rbefore that#k!" />

In other words, all the work you and #b#p2050009##k have been doing was for nothing.  #b#p2050008##k and I will take care of the alien problem so you don't have to worry about it." />
