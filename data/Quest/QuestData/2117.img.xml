The only way to prevent the monster from ever coming back is to scientifically study the origin of the monster. The best way to do it would be for me to take a look at them myself, but I have so many other researches to conduct that I need you to gather up #b5 each of #t4000196# and #t4000197##k that #r#o2230110##k and #r#o2230111##k possess.
