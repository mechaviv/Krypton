I am sure you know your way around Victoria Island much better than I do, but just to make sure, here's how to get there: \nHead east of Kerning City, and you'll see a path that heads north that leads to Perion. Follow that route, and you'll reach #bConstruction Site North of Kerning City#k. It's huge, but in that area, you'll find an entrance that leads to the #bAbandoned Subway Station#k. Once there, tell Mr. Lim I sent you there." />
