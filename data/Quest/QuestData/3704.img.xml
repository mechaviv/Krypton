        <string name="1" value="Apparently something did happen at Leafre. I asked Pam what's up, and the concern was that the Hafrings living at the town ran into Kentauruses at the forest and were badly injured. To heal those Hafrings will require a medicine, and the #bChief Tatamo#k mentioned that #b80 #t4000241##k are required to make the medicine. I'll have to gather up #b80 #t4000241##k now for the wounded Hafrings.\n\n#i4000241##t4000241#  #b#c4000241##k / 80" />
