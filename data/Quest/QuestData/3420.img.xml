        <string name="1" value="I met with Yellow Mesoranger at a field around Omega Sector. She alerted me that she's aware of the fact that I helped out Alien Gray, and that if I am to dispel the notion that I'm on the alien's side, I'll have to make an effort to make-up for my blunders. In order to regain their trust, I'll have to eliminate the aliens. \n\n#o4230118# #r#a34201#" />
        <string name="2" value="I may have helped out Alien Gray in a moment of chaos, but after successfully completing the mission Yellow Mesoranger gave me, I think I regained some of her trust. It just seems like the aliens do not want to peacefully coexist with us." />

            <string name="1" value="It's only a matter of time before the Sector finds out about this, and who knows? You may be classified as an alien-supporter, too. Well, but then again, you really didn't know any better... What do you think? Would you like to take on my mission to regain at least my trust?" />

Just show it to us that you're NOT an alien-supporter, and if you're not a supporter, you would have no trouble whatsoever going in the battle against them." />

They are pretty strong, so it'll be best for you to team up with other people in order to complete this mission faster. I'll be here awaiting good news from you." />
