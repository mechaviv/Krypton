This time he wants to deviate from the scientific approach to flight and opts for the magical approach, and asks me to see his best friend #b#p1032106##k at Ellinia, the town of fairies. Apparently Wing the Fairy knows the way to make #b'#t4031163#'#k...I'll need to see that fairy at Ellinia for Icarus's sake." />
