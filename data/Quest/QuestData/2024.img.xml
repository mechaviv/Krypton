        <string name="1" value="I ran into #bRowen#k again, the same Rowen who I got a fresh milk from for Ronnie, the son of Mr. Wetbottom. She seemed to be keeping her guards up against humans then, but it looks like she's accepting me as Ronnie's friend...Rowen is assistant of the head magician of Ellinia, Grendel the Really Old, and he's been concerned about the cursed dolls that Grendel the Really Old made with his black magic a long long time ago. The dolls had been sealed up for a while, until a bunch of Lupin's took them and ran away. They have since turned into zombies, and have been destroying the forest. To return the forest to how it was before, someone needs to take down the Zombie Lupin's and take away the #bcursed dolls#k from them ... well, I readily accepted the request of collecting #b100 cursed dolls#k, but am I going to be okay against those crazy monkeys??" />
        <string name="2" value="I took down a bunch of Zombie Lupin's on a forest near Ellinia, and collected all #b100 cursed dolls#k for Rowen. In return, she gave me 7 ores. Will the forest really return to normal with this?" />

            <string name="1" value="Allow me to introduce myself. I'm #p1032101#, secretary of the Head Magician in this town, #b#p1032001##k. We've been looking for a traveler who can help out our town and its troubles. Well, would you like to hear the whole story?" />
            <string name="2" value="#p1032001# used to be very much into #bblack magic#k, which was considered off limits. The black magic is VERY powerful, but it risks the magician of losing the ability to do magic altogether. It's a very potent magic that needs to be carefully used." />
            <string name="3" value="#p1032001# wasn't fully trained, but thought nothing of the black magic and started working on a forbidden magic that brings life to a doll made out of straw. I'm sure you're aware of the fact that the one forbidden magic in this world is that of life, anything that has to do with life itself." />
            <string name="4" value="But something went terribly wrong in the process and... the curse of black magic wound up seeping into the doll, thus becoming a #r#t4000031##k, having to be encased and sealed up forever. In the end, #p1032001# sealed #t4000031# up and placed it somewhere unknown." />
            <string name="5" value="But then the #o3210800# that lived around the #m101000000# forest took the doll, went back into the forest, and became zombies. The #bZombie #o3210800##k are now ruining the forest as a result. #p1032001# assigned me to handle the situation, but ... for me to do this alone ..." />
