She spends all the tax money to bring in unfathomable amounts of treasures.\r\n#L0##bWhat does the Sultan do?#l" />

            <string name="2" value="Fortunately there are brave people who do. They serve as inspiration to the residents of #m260000000#. If this heroic group of bandits, called the Sand Bandits, didn't steal the queen's treasures and hand them to the people here, then the city would've been long dead by now.\r\n#L0##bThe Sand Bandits?
