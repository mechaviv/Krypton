        <string name="1" value="#b#m220000000##k #b#p2041022##k's problem was more difficult than I imagined.  It's hard enough finding a #b#t04021005##k, but to freely donate it to the king of #b#m220000000##k!?  But if it's true that every great adventurer must learn to generously donate, maybe I need to consider donating as well. \nPlus, according to #b#p2041022##k, the king is a very generous person so it will probably be used to help those in need... This is stressful.\n\n" />
        <string name="2" value="I don't know if I made the right decision, but I gave away #b#t04021005##k to #b#p2041022##k.  I feel like I've somewhat wasted it but I guess it does feel good to know that I've helped someone in need.  Overall, it was a good experience." />
