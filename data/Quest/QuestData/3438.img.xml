        <string name="1" value="I met General Maestro, who's in command of a humongous army at the Omega Sector. The general said we'll be able to obtain the powerless, lightless #bDull Crystal#k that have been used up at the Eos Tower from #bDrum Bunnies#k. While most would dismiss the item as nothing more than a useless crystal, the general believed it had something important hidden in it, and that he requested me to gather up #b20 Dull crystals#k at the Eos Tower. I'll need to get those crystals from the Drum Bunnies at the tower.\n\n#t4031135# #b#c4031135##k/20" />
        <string name="2" value="Just like the way General Mastro instructed, I went to Eos Tower, took out took out the Drum Bunnies, and gathered up #b20 Dull crystals#k for him. While looking at the crystal, he mentioned that there must be something inside these crystals to turn these previously-adorable Drum Bunnies to something of a menace. I wonder exactly what's inside it." />

            <string name="1" value="But no one knows why, and the situation is getting worse by day. What is going on there? Is it the act of an alien? Or something else? All I know is, I can't leave this post because I'm the general. Please help me take care of other things." />

                <string name="1" value="Defeat the #b#o3230400##k, a monster featured at the 60th floor of Eos Tower, and you'll sometimes find an item called #b#t4031135##k. Hardly anyone knows what to do with it, but I think it's a very important item. Inside that item lies the clues to the case." />

                <string name="1" value="And then, one by one, they started turning into monsters. I had a hunch that this crystal has something to do with it, and I'm afraid I'm right on this. It's not enough, though. I'll need to study this from different angles, so I can find out exactly what happened in the first place." />

We were able to find an important clue towards solving the crime, but we haven't solved it yet. I'll try to figure it out, but I am pretty sure I may need your help down the road. Please drop by whenever you have time. I'll see you around." />

I really think there's a correlation between the previously-gentle dolls suddenly becoming monsters in rage, and an item called #b#t4031135##k. Please head to the 60th floor of the Eos Tower, defeat #b#o3230400##k, and then collect #b20 #t4031135#s#k for me." />
