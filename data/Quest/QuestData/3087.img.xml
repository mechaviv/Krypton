        <string name="1" value="I ran into a mysterious girl at #p2032001#'s house. She mentioned that the reason Orbis is sinking is because there are too many monsters around at the Cloud Terrace these days. She requested that I take out #b80 each#k of #r#o3210200#, #o3210201#, and #o3210202##k.\n\n#o3210200# #r#a30871##k\n#o3210201# #r#a30872##k\n#o3210202# #r#a30873##k" />
        <string name="2" value="Just the way the mysterious girl at #p2032001#'s house requested, I took out a 80 each of #o3210200#, #o3210201#, and #o3210202#. Doing this may have slowed down Orbis's inevitable crash, but that still means it'll crash later. By the way, who is this girl? She must be aware of the danger that's befallen Orbis. I should talk to her again..." />

For now, the best thing we can do is lessen the weight of Orbis to delay the inevitable crashing or Orbis to the ground." />
