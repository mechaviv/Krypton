He said he had to ask me for help since the new robot isn't ready just yet... I need to head over to the hidden place at the Boswell Field and defeat at least 5 #bMT-09#k's.\n\n#o5120100# #r#a34081#" />
        <string name="2" value="I managed to eliminate all 5 MT-09's that Dr. Kim of the Command Center requested. I really hope that the new robot is made soon, so I don't have to ever do this again." />

The problem is, the new robot is still on its developmental stage... arrght, this is driving me crazy! You... if  that's fine with you, will you please help us out? We need your word right now." />

The word is, there's a group of Mateon aliens on their way here, and one of the most powerful Mateons around, #b#o5120100##k, is already undercover, waiting around the Boswell Field. #b#o5120100##k is definitely unlike anyone else you've ever faced, and even our army is having a difficult time handling it. I guess it's too powerful a monster for even a disciplined army like ours." />
                <string name="1" value="What I'm asking from you is simple. Please go and defeat 5 #b#o5120100#s#k, which is operated by the aliens. #b#o5120100##k is the culmination of advanced technology from the aliens, so they are much more devastating than anything you've ever run into. I strongly suggest that you take them on with a party, not just by yourself. I'll be waiting for you here. Good luck!" />

I am sincerely thankful to have run into someone like you in times of need. Now, it's my job to fully develop the new robot so I don't put all your work in vain.
