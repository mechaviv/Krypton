                <string name="0" value="That's good to hear. I can't thank you enough for saying yes because the favor I want to ask of you involves a very personal matter. See, I have a boyfriend named #bGail#k, a sweet-hearted fella with a passion for the ocean." />
                <string name="1" value="A while ago, he volunteered to go on an expedition to investigate the signs of anomaly that were occuring at the deep ocean. I was able to keep in touch with him for a bit, but I haven't been able to talk to him the past few days. I'm concerned about his well-being, because the deep part of the ocean is not to be messed with, a dangerous place for anyone to venture into. So dangerous, in fact, that I can't even fathom going there myself." />
                <string name="2" value="A few days ago, Melias of the Armor Store told me this interesting story. He said there's a sea witch living at the entrance of the deep ocean called #b#p2060100##k, and apparently, she is a great fortune-teller who sees everything." />
                <string name="3" value="Go talk to that sea witch and ask her the whereabouts of #bGail#k. I'm too weak to go all the way down to the bottom of the ocean, but you seem more than strong enough to do so. I'm sure you'll run into her there. Thanks~" />
