            <string name="0" value="Hi there. Don't worry. I won't forget all you've done for me. \nLook, look at Lionel! The baby's cured!\nHahah, look at Lionel nuzzling against your legs! Lionel must really like you!" />
            <string name="1" value="It really is one quiet, subdued baby, to the point where I can't imagine it being a monster. I'd love to be with it until the end, but I know that's not going to happen. I plan on freeing Lionel once it is fully healthy. The problem is that, until I do so, I HAVE to keep it inside this house. I know it's not right to keep it indoors at all times, but... no one else better recognize what's in here. Lionel may not come out here alive if that happens." />
            <string name="2" value="Oh yeah! \nIf we disguise it to where it doesn't look like a monster, by dressing it up with... a necklace! It'll make Lionel look like a housecat. \nLook! It's so small and adorable. I think it's a great idea! Let's make a necklace for Lionel!" />
            <string name="3" value=" ...but, if I buy it here, I'll attract unwanted attention anyway. But...if I ask Teo of Lith Harbor for a little favor, he'll do it for me. Can you ask him for me?" />

I am not an expert at this, but anyway, I'll do anything for that little girl." />
