Destroying #o5110301# wouldn't be impossible... but why? Does this have something to do with getting in the way of the Zenumist Society?  \n\n#o5110301# #r#a33131##k " />

Something doesn't seem right... you are much, much more powerful than other alchemists we have here. How can someone who's been conducting experiments for such a short period of time be so strong...?" />
            <string name="1" value="Hmm, well that doesn't matter. (It's a good opportunity, in fact...) Maybe... someone like you can slay #o5110301#, no? Alcadnos spent a long time building #o5110301#, and although they aren't created for battle purposes, they are plenty strong enough... but I think you're more than capable of beating them. What do you think? Are you interested?" />
