            <string name="1" value="The story tells of an immortal bird which can live forever. This creature could only be the Phoenix. Many have said it's wings of fire are everlasting...that is why it is called an Immortal Bird. Such a powerful creature...\n\r#L0# #bIsn't is just a legend?#k" />
            <string name="2" value=" I thought so at first. But then, my friend in El Nath told me he saw a nest of #o9300089# in the glowing lava. Isn't that wonderfull? I suppose they're real after all! \n\r#L0# #bYes, it is.#k" />
            <string name="3" value="#o9300089# probably doesn't hatch because it is beneath a snowy mountain. #o9300089# is a bird so it will hatch when it can see the sky. If you are interested in #o9300089#, I suggest that you get the eggs! My mind can't bear the thought of those birds trapped, yearning for a glimpse at the sun...Are you game for some adventure?" />
