        <string name="1" value="I ran into John the fisherman again at Lith Harbor. This time, he told me his mother passed away recently, and he wanted to get her some White Violas for her. He asked me to get #b30 White Violas#k for him. The scent of White Violas last over 1000 years...and according to John, they can be found through the mysterious statue again, where the flower may be found. Man ... do I HAVE to go in there again??" />
        <string name="2" value="I got John all #b30 White Violas#k. It has a nice scent to it, but 30 of them? Makes my head spin...As a sign of appreciation, John gave me a set of his mother's earrings. These earrings look like they are made of some common flowers, but it seems there's something to it..." />

I need a special kind of flower for her on her grave ... can you get them for me?" />

I can't believe you went deep into the forest and got these flowers... there's a story about this flower where it supposedly doesn't die for 1000 years and it glows on its own. I can make a nice wreath out of this and bring it to my mother's grave..." />
