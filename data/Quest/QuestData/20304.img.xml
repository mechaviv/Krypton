Once I find him, I'll need to defeat him in a battle and bring back #b#t4032101##k in the process. The problem is that the enemy, being the #o9001009#, is adept at transforming into different people, so I better talk to each and every one of them to figure out who's real or fake. \n\n#o9001009##r #a203041##k\n#i4032104# #t4032104# #b#c4032104# / 1#k" />
