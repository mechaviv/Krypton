        <string name="1" value="#p2111005# was studying #o5110301#, the ones that the alchemists from Alcadno came up with. She said to thoroughly investigate #o5110301#, she'll need #t4000364#... I better get her #b80 #t4000364#k from #o5110301# for her, so she can continue her research.  \n\n#i4000364##t4000364# #b#c4000364##k/80 " />
