            <string name="0" value="Have you seen #o2110300#s roaming around outside #b#m261000000##k? There weren't that many in the beginning, but their numbers have swelled these days... and they have gotten much more violent than before. It's not just #o2110300#, either. It includes #o3110301# and #o2110301#, too. There just weren't that many of them before." />
            <string name="1" value="As the researches conducted by Alcadno have really picked up, their numbers have increased as well. I don't know the exact reason behind it... but I do know that Alcadno's ways have definitely affected the environment around #m261000000#. The one that really exasperated the whole thing is the incident that occurred with an alchemist from Alcadno." />
            <string name="2" value="The very nature of the studies conducted by Alcadno breaks the fundamental rules of nature. Have you seen the roids that they've made? Life is precious as it is. Anything that's mechanical is fake. The problem is, Alcadno is slowly blurring the boundaries of life. I can't just sit and watch them destroy the nature's course!" />
            <string name="3" value="Ahh!! But what we need to take care of right this minute is #r#o2110300##k! They keep munching off the bottom of the half-completed Flying Ships. This is terrible, we won't be able to complete the construction if this vicious cycle keeps repeating itself. I want you to go there and kill off those #o2110300#s." />

                <string name="0" value="Really? You'll do it? Great! #r#o2110300#s#k can be found en masse at the outer skirts of #m261000000#, so I want you to destroy #r150#k of them for now. Thanks in advance!" />

            <string name="0" value="You managed to eliminate all the #o2110300#s. I believe the reason why #o2110300#s, more than anything else, caused so much trouble was because the Alcadnos experimented with #o2110300#s. The Life Alchemy? It sounds good, in theory only." />
            <string name="1" value="But, it's not something humans can control with their bare hands. It's not something they should be able to control, period. A proposed union between a machine and a living being? A cold piece of metal emerging with a human body? That means the destruction of mankind!  It's just that the Alcadno Sect seems to ignore such a thing. " />
            <string name="2" value="Anyway, thanks to your work, #o2110300#s should stay quiet for a foreseeable future. Thank you." />
