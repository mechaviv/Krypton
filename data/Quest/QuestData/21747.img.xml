        <string name="1" value="According to #p2091007#, the Seal Stone of #m250000000# is stored in a place called #m925040100# and the entrance is somewhere between the pillars of #m250000100# and #b#m250020300##k. Find the pillar that has &quot;Entrance&quot; engraved on it and say the password to enter the premises. The password is #bActions speak louder than words#k. You'd better enter #m925040100# and stop #r#o9300351##k, then return to Mu Gong.\r\n\r\n#o9300351##r #a217471##k" />
        <string name="2" value="You defeated #o9300351# in #m925040100#, but the Seal Stone of #m250000000# was taken from you by the Gentleman of the Black Wings. It seems to be a recurring pattern. When you told #p2091007# that the Seal Stone was stolen, he admitted that he himself did not know the true use of that stone and reassured you that all is well in #m250000000# even if the Seal Stone has been taken." />
