        <string name="1" value="#p1201002# confesses that, because he spent the last few hundred years without a master, the hint of darkness that existed in his heart has begun to spiral out of control in the form of rage. He's begging you to get rid of the rage. Apparently, if you defeat #p1201002#, the rage will stop. It doesn't look easy by any means, but it is what a master must do. You'd better take on the #r#o9001014##k.\r\n\r\n#o9001014##r #a214011##k" />
        <string name="2" value="You were able to defeat the #o9001014#. Once the rage subsided, #p1201002# helped awaken more of your past powers." />
