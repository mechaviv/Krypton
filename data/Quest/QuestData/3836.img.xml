He is currently in exile out of this town, hoping for the spells to weaken as time goes by...  \n\n No Gong suspected that since he helped Tae Soo out, the spell might be weakening the grip on him, and wanted me to confirm this with #bDo Gong#k." />

The only way this bright kid is wandering around like a loose cannon these days is because of that Master Goblin." />
            <string name="1" value="Tae Roon had always been a thorn on Master Goblin's side, because he was dedicated to defeating Goblins, so one day Master Goblin casted a spell on him that made him lose his mind. All he did was let go of himself for a bit, and Tae Roon lost his mind. Once that happened... he began to attack the good people in this town, as well as numerous travelers..." />
            <string name="2" value="It broke my heart knowing that I couldn't do anything to help him get back on his feet. The only thing I could do to help Tae Roon, who felt miserable by his actions everytime he regained consciousness, to... exile him from this town so he won't injure another person." />
            <string name="3" value="For that Tae Roon to help Tae Soo... Maybe the spell on him has weakened over time... if the spell cast upon him by Master Goblin can be broken, then Tae Roon will be able to live in the friendly confines Mu Lung, just like the old times. Can you check up on this?" />

He's a student of Mu Lung, first and foremost, even before being No Gong's student. It breaks my heart seeing a fine kid being controlled by Master Goblin, and I can't let that go on. Hold on for a second." />
