            <string name="0" value="I want to thank you. You've been pushed to your limits in helping us, and shown you're a true Urban Warrior. As my way of saying thanks, I want you to have this chair. Check it out, and be sure to come back anytime you want. New Leaf City wouldn't be here without you! \n\n#L0##bSo, about that favor you mentioned...#k#l" />
            <string name="1" value="We're tight, but not that tight yet. I'll tell you in time though... \n\n#L0##bI've noticed the city has quite a bit of diversity!#k#l" />
            <string name="2" value="Yes. I felt it'd be best to be a little different. Masteria is a big place, and while we're only just starting, I have a feeling we're in for one wild ride! \n\n#L0##bWhat's up with you and Lita?#k#l" />
            <string name="3" value="We're very good friends, but nothing more. She's a tough one, though! \n\n#L0##bJohn and Elpam both mentioned another world, Versal. What do you know about this?#k#l" />
            <string name="4" value="Well, there's a rumor that a portal can be opened somehow from within the city, but I'm not sure how that's possible. \n\n#L0##bWhat do you mean? You built this city.#k#l" />
            <string name="5" value="Correction-I rebuilt this city. The foundations are still there, as is some of the technology; you've probably seen some of it when you were outside the city. There's some stuff that just works, and I don't mean the Foxwit Doors themselves-I mean the energy that powers them. Foxwit is a genius and some of that is way beyond even his understanding. I'm a bit wary of using it all, just because of the old tales of Masteria-the immortal warriors, a mad scientist, a threat from the stars, some of their legends are pretty heavy stuff. In addition to that, this is where Subani and Naricain are originally from. Not the city, another region of Masteria. John probably mentioned that. \n\n#L0##bJust level with me, Icebyrd. Tell me what you know.#k#l" />
            <string name="6" value="Ok, but keep this a secret, don't want people panicking. The Masteria of old was a sprawling utopia, one far advanced in technology. However, their ambition far outstripped their control of the technology, and there was an accident. Masteria, the great land, finally fell into the sea, its secrets lost forever. Until now. I made a deal with someone to raise the continent, and establish the city in the ruins of Olde Sapp Village. He brought my dream to life, and it cost me next to nothing. And that's where we are now. However, the city has many, many secrets that even I don't know about. Tread carefully; you never know what can open up... \n\n#L0##bOk, I know what how it was raised, but who raised it? What did you have to do?#k#l" />
            <string name="7" value="That's a bit personal, but I will Say this-if there's ever a time when you need to know more, I'll tell you. Until then, don't worry about it. That burden is mine alone to bear. For now, just let me give you a gift for the appreciation of helping our city." />
