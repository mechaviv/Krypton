You could tell he's been waiting for his master for a long time judging from the wrinkly, dirty, unruly hair he features. I wanted to help him out, but I cannot understand whatever Moppie is uttering. I need someone as a translator so I can talk to him, but ... should I ask for a person, or a fairy?" />
