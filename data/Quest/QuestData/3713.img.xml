        <string name="2" value="There's a huge wooden entryway leading into #m100030000# which I'd never seen before. It almost looks like an entryway to a fortress... I should try talking to #p1094000#, who was standing in front of me. I remember him telling me that a #bpirate #p1072008##k fort is being built here.  It looks nearly complete..." />

            <string name="0" value="We, the Hafrings, have coexisted with the Dragons for a long, long time. Our friendship with the Dragons have helped us immensely in that we did not need to protect ourselves in case of danger, for the Dragons were there to do so. We just wanted nothing more than a simple, quiet life in the forest." />
            <string name="1" value="That does not mean we should be oblivious to what is happening in this continent. After the loss of Nine Spirit, it has become evident that we the Hafrings will also need to step up and defend ourselves in times of danger. I believe this is that time." />
            <string name="2" value="A #bnew force#k is primed to change everything in the Maple World. It's laying dormant for now, but... it won't be long until they fully show themselves to the public. I want to know if the new force is to be welcomed, or to be feared... and... I'd like for you to do that for us. Can you?" />

Wait, this is not it. What are you trying to do there? Whatever you are trying to do, it won't fool me! Not #p1094000#!" />
            <string name="2" value="We ride around on our ship, The Nautilus, under the guidance of our captain, Kyrin, roaming around the coasts of Maple World, looking for the Black Magician. We use Knucklers and Guns to make sure that the root of all evil is vanquished--we want to make sure that the Black Magician never rises to the heights of power as he did before." />
            <string name="3" value="Just like the wisemen in Victoria Island training for the day the Black Magician returns, #p1072008# is busy making sure that his followers stay in low numbers.  She's so young, too. That's just so admirable!" />

We're not aliens or anything like that! We're just Pirates.  Fearsome, fight-to-the-last-man, potion-loving Pirates! Don't tell me you are thinking of Lord Pirate and those despicable bandits.  They suck!  We serve a cause much more true to the spirit of Victoria Island!" />

If you want to join us and #p1072008# and become a mighty  #bGunslinger or Brawler#k, come back later. By then, we'll be ready to accept you with open arms, and train you to live the life of a Pirate!" />
