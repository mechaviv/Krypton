        <string name="1" value="Moren's coworker Keol requested that I make a shoe for him. Even though Moren had already accepted me as his apprentice, it seemed that Keol didn't agree with that. Apparently, he wasn't very pleased with Moren that he was willing to divulge his item-making secrets to everyone, regardless of the skill level. Keol asked me to make a pair of shoes for him... that even a Level 1 can make with ease. Seriously... does he think that low of me? Fine, I'll make the finest pair of those he'll ever see!\n\n#i4001174# #t4001174# #b#c4001174# / 1" />

Keol asked me to make a pair of shoes for him... that even a Level 1 can make with ease. Seriously... does he think that low of me? But even after seeing my work, Keol just dismissed it as little more than adequate. He also commented that I'll need lots of practice, and gave me a measly Basic Enhancement Gem. I don't like this guy... and I definitely don't like his attitude." />
