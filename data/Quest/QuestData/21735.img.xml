        <string name="1" value="#p1002104# says that ever since he got ambushed by the #o9300346#s, he's been using any means necessary to find the Seal Stone. He feels that holding on to the Seal Stone would be dangerous, so he wants to store it in #b#m140000000##k, the deserted island. I'd better deliver the #bSeal Stone to #p1201000##k." />
        <string name="2" value="#t4032323#. No one knows what its purpose is, but it is obvious that Black Wings want it. Desperately. You can't let that happen… Just as you're thinking this, #p1201000# hands you a new skill called the #bCombo Drain#k." />
