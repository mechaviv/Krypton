The ones I need to meet up are #bStaff Sergeant Charlie, Corporal Easy, and Sergeant Bravo#k, and they should be around Ossyria. He'd prefer that I meet them in the order of their ranks... that sounds pretty difficult to me ..." />

            <string name="0" value="Hey! Attention! Oh, I'm sorry ... If you're not busy and all, can I ask you for help? Let me introduce myself. I am #b#p2020003##k from the Alpha platoon. We got on the aeroboat to get here to complete an important mission when there was an accident on the plane. We all had to parachute our way down." />
            <string name="1" value="The problem is, I can't find any of my men that I parachuted with around here. We were supposed to gather up here, but days have passed and I still haven't heard a word from my men. Because of that, can you find them for me? They are all over Ossyria, scattered everywhere. I'm not asking you to do this for free, of course. I'll reward you for your hard work." />

Instead of finding them randomly, can you find them according to the #rorder of the ranks#k? Of course you should know which rank is low and which one is high, right? hahaha" />
                <string name="1" value="Since they have made emergency landings all over Ossyria following through with the operation, it'll require you to search every corner of this place, be it towns, fields, etc. Please see my men from the highest rank down, and if they have something for me, please take them and give them to me in the end. I'll be waiting you then. Good luck!" />
