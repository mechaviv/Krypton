            <string name="0" value="You look happy young man~  I have never felt this empty in my life when I should be singing and dancing for the Christmas...  Recently, as Santa Claus has gained too much weight, 4 Rudolphs were never enough to lead him and his sledge full of presents.  He was quite worried about that.  So... I had to let him take my #bTorr#k who I have been taking care of since I was young." />
            <string name="1" value="I know that Santa Claus will take a good care of him but I am still worried if other Rudolphs might make fun of him since Torr is so weak and faint-hearted.  Torr has always been next to me through out the years and now that I don't have him here with me, this is what makes feel so lonely." />
            <string name="2" value="But, there are some good things that I can enjoy too.  Christmas is the only chance for me to see Santa Claus and Rudolphs flying beautifully in the sky.  That's why I have climed up to the 2nd floor but it is still hard to see because of the other tall houses...  And I know better than anyone I can't climb up anymore with old body of mine..." />
            <string name="3" value="So, will you be kind enough to make it to the highest point of the town and take a picture of my #bTorr#k who will be leading the sledge in a dashing figure?" />

                <string name="0" value="I could tell from the first sight that you will be able to do me a favor.  Your eyes are so kind.  Thanks.  Now, climb up to the highest point of the town and you will find a tripod to hold the camera up there.  Please take a picture of brave Torr leading the sledge there." />
                <string name="1" value="Torr was the 5th one to be joined in the Santa's sledge club so he will be leading the sledge in the last, 5th row.  Take a good picture of him, showing his face clearly.  That picture will be my only pleasure to get over my yearning for Torr this year." />
