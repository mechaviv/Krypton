        <string name="1" value="I apparently need to do some intense training in order to be able to freely use the super transformation skill. One of the benefits of super transformation is that it will strengthen me and give me a body of steel! I'd better go observe the Blue Dragon Turtles whose bodies are equally as hard, and try to stand up against them. To prove that I've completed the training, I must defeat #r150 Blue Dragon Turtles#k and bring #b50 Sturdy Leather #k pieces to Kyrin. \n\n#i4031871##t4031871#  #b#c4031871# / 50#k \n#o8140700#  #r#a63501##k " />

Those turtles are also notorious for possessing rock-hard bodies. I Say... how about engaging in a battle with them? Experience first hand how the Blue Dragon Turtles utilize their bodies against the opposition." />
