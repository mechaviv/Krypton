        <string name="2" value="I successfully completed the mission from Black Mesoranger by defeating the #bBarnard Grays#k. It seems, however, that there will be much more dangerous aliens monsters around Kulan Field" />

Maybe there's a force of evil controlling them... Anyway, I would love to reach out for your help. Would you like to at least listen to the whole story?" />

                <string name="1" value="They are the weakest among the Grays, so that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Grays are very class-driven, and the lowest guys actually approach the Omega Sector as close as they can possibly get. Please take care of them, and then come back to me, okay? Best of luck to you!" />

Were they really that close to the Sector? Anyway, this is so awesome! I know this isn't much, but please take it." />
