Leatty and Drumming Rabbit you see are normally too powerful monsters to be here, or for you to handle. The ones you see here, however, are lacking of any power, thanks to #b#p1032001##k, the head of all magicians who sealed up their power. These are here for the sole purpose of training. Here's your task : Take down #b1 x #o9409000##k and #b1 x #o9409001##k, pick up its dropping, and go see #b#p9101001##k, who should be up there somewhere. It's that easy." />
