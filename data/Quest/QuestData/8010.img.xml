                <string name="0" value="I like pretty objects, the ones that sparkle, because they do not turn their backs on me like humans did. I admit, what I did was stealing, and if the owner wants it back, then I'll have to return it, but you know what? I've been abused by humans for so long, as are all the kitties here. That's why, I don't feel like just giving away the item for free. We'll do it like this, then. I'll give you the questions, and you answer them all. If you answer them all right, then the Orange Marble is yours. Remember, these questions aren't for free~. You will need to get me #b300 fried chickens#k first to start the quiz. Each time you get it wrong, it will cost you #b300 fried chickens#k to start again." />
