        <string name="1" value="I'm helping Mom and Dad make Thanksgiving dinner! I have to gather one of each ingredient: 1 ear of #b#t2020029##k, a can of #b#t2022262##k, a #b#t2022263##k, bowl of #b#t2022264##k and best of all, #b#t2022261##k. They promised me an #b#t4031529##k if I return quickly. I guess the Turkeys stole all the ingredients to make Thanksgiving fixins'... I guess they think that without the fixins', there'll be no dinner!  No dinner?  No way!  Time to defeat some battle-hardened Turkeys!" />
        <string name="2" value="My trusty weapon did a fine job of ruffling those rowdy turkeys' feathers, and I obtained all of the ingredients for Mom and Dad. In return, they gave me my #b#t4031529##k! I guess doing chores does pay off! I can take this to any of the Store Vendors in New Leaf City, and receive a #bNexon Game Card#k for it! ...I'd better get out of here before Aunt Petunia shows up! Mom mentioned that I can help her with dinner once a day until it's time to eat!" />

I heard from Grandma Benson that it looks like those crazy Turkeys armed themselves this year.  Apparently they robbed all the markets of all the items for Thanksgiving fixins'.  Unbelievable!  What are those Turkeys thinking and what is this world coming to?  Well... I would try hunting these and you should be able to get back the things I need.  Maybe you can even bring back an extra turkey... wouldn't that be something!  Hurry back so I can start cooking soon!" />
