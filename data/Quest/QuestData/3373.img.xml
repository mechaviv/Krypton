I wonder if she'll really give it to Romeo, because it is DEFINITELY FOR WOMEN!! I knew something wasn't right. Despite the concerns, Juliet asked me to give this &quot;dress&quot; to #bRomeo#k." />
        <string name="2" value="Romeo seemed very happy to receive the clothes that Juliet made for him. Seriously, is he going to wear that dress with the pink ribbon on? Alchemists are really strange.. that's for sure." />
