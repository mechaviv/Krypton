        <string name="1" value="I ran into Manji from Perion again, the same Manji that I met while I was helping the little Maya get her medicine. He was shocked by my stronger appearance, and wanted to ask me for a favor. Long long ago, he was in danger of being attacked by Balrog, only to be saved by the legendary hero Tristan. He died in place of Manji, and for that, he's been keeping that sword to this day. Too bad the sword has been soaked in Balrog's evilness and is as ragged as possible. It's too embarrassing to even call it a sword now. Anyway, he gave me the #rOld Gladius#k and wanted me to reawaken it for him. If it indeed gets reawaken, it becomes the #bHero's Gladius#k ...I should go see Chrishrama of Sleepywood just the way Manji said it..." />
        <string name="2" value="It seems that this Gladius which Manji told me is one fine sword. I had to make a hard decision choosing one bwtween the #bGladius#k and the #bSkull Earring#k which Manji offered me, but I will not regret." />

If you have indeed gotten that much stronger, then I'd like to see it firsthand. Did you put #t4031005# to good use? Well, it's all in the past, so ..." />

I felt a sense of danger inside but that didn't prevent me from walking further into the cave." />

After rescuing me, he was struck by Balrog's teeth and fell down the cliff. He was ... yes, the hero of legendary proportion, Tristan." />
                <string name="4" value="I went all the way down to where he ultimately fell. He didn't look like he had much of a chance. Before it was too late, he handed me the #b#t1302014##k, by then worn-out by the sheer evil of Balrog, and then passed away. This is that same sword right here. I would love to restore this to its original state." />
                <string name="5" value="The sword becomes #b#t1302015##k once it is reawaken. However, as for the details of how to reawaken it, I have no idea. I think you have to eliminate the evil force of Balrog, though ... You should go see #p1061000# from #m105040300# and ask about it." />
