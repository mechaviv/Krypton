        <string name="1" value="According to #p2032001#, #m920030001# is where the #bSeal Stone is hidden#k. The only way to enter #m920030001# is through a stem of the Nependeath which connects #m200060001# to #m920030001#. An intruder has actually grown the #o9300347# for this specific purpose. #p2032001# is desperately asking you to prevent the intruders from entering..." />
        <string name="2" value="So you came face to face with a #o9300348# in #m920030001# and successfully defeated it, but ended up losing the Seal Stone to a member of the Black Wings, #o9300349#, who snatched it away from you. When you asked #p2032001# what you should do, she told you that she doesn't know what they want the Seal Stone for and sat quietly with a grim expression." />

            <string name="1" value="There's only one way to get to #m920030001#. There's a #bflower pot at the center of#k #m200060001#, and you must make the Nependeath inside the pot grow so it'll connect to #m920030001#. Then you climb up the branches all the way to #m920030001#." />
            <string name="2" value="Which means… The reason the #o9300347# was found in #m200060001# is because #rsomeone is trying to enter #m920030001##k. Although the intruder failed because their approach was incorect, they will be back, and they will succeed. We'll need to prevent them from doing that, and... it'll be up to you to stop them." />
