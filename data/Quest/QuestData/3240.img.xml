        <string name="1" value="Somewhere around Ludibrium, I saw a small fairy that was glowing all over her body. Her name was Wisp, and is a part of Mar the Fairy. She saw my pet in a state of doll and claimed that she can turn my doll pet back into a real-life pet with #bwater of life#k and #bmcdonald's#k. The Scroll of Life is apparently at #bCloy's House#k in Ludibrium, which should be empty at this point." />
        <string name="2" value="I found the #bscroll of life#k at #bCloy's house#k in Ludibrium. I gave this, along with the #bWater of Life#k, to Wisp and he helped turn my pet back alive. I need to have some play time with my pet now!" />
