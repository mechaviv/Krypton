        <string name="1" value="#p9120003# was indeed annoyed by something. She was disturbed that the #t4000222#s that are being used at #m800000000# is apparently stuck with ghosts. This isn't annoying; this is downright creepy. I better kill #b100 #o9400011#s#k and get her some #b#t4000222#s#k, just the way #p9120003# said.\n\n#o9400011# #r#a43061##k \n#t4000222# #b#c4000222#/50" />
        <string name="2" value="I eliminated #o9400011# and got some #t4000222#s for use. The more I think about it, I think #o9400011# is much more of a dangerous presence than an unlit street at night." />

No no, there's nothing to worry. It's really nothing. Just go ahead and kill #b100 #o9400011#s#k, and I also want you to gather up #b50 #t4000222#s#k to be used at various places in this town.
