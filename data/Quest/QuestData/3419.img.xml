        <string name="1" value="I ran into #bAlien Gray#k at Kulan Field around Omega Sector. He claimed that it's the Omega Sector, not them, that's been the bad one, and it asked me to help it invade the Sector by getting a number of materials from the Omega Sector Silo. I really don't feel good about helping it, but... oh well... I'll need to enter the Omega Sector Silo and bring out #b3 Secret Documents#k. \n\n#t4031116# #b#c4031116##k/3" />
        <string name="2" value="I got the 3 secret documents out of the Silo and handed them to #bAlien Gray#k, which was at Kulan Field of Omega Sector. I was richly rewarded for my effort, but I can't believe I fell for Gray's lies... I better hope the Omega Sector does not find out about the fact that I actually helped out the aliens..." />

                <string name="0" value="I knew I could talk to you. Thanks for making some time for us. I have a small, discreet favor to ask you, so please listen carefully. You've met those people at the Omega Sector, right? Are you... aware of exactly what they REALLY do, though?" />
                <string name="1" value="They probably told you they're here to take down the aliens, but in truth... it's NOT US that's a threat to the society; it's THEM. They are mercilessly attacking us, when the only crime we've committed is to try to coexist with the humans here." />
                <string name="2" value="Their real ambition is to win the public by declaring war on the strange-looking aliens, then just when the public is at their side, they take over the world. Isn't that sickening? Every one of you is falling for it. That's why... I want you to do something to help us fight against them." />

The boxes probably contain classified information regarding the Omega Sector, so it's something we really need to have. I'll be here waiting for you..." />

I'll give you an item that'll allow you to summon us in case you find yourself in trouble, but please pick your spots when do that, because you may find yourself in deep trouble if you don't, okay?" />

You really thought the great Grays will actually 'coexist' with dirtbags like you? Please... this is why the humans are at the bottom of the chain. This will accelerate our invasion of Ludibirum!" />
                <string name="1" value="Now what would happen if they find out you've done all this for us? I suggest you run away before they find out that you've been the one helping out the aliens!!! Hahaha... I don't need you now, so get out of my sight!!" />
