Think you could spare a second to help out on a paranormal investigation? \r\n\r\n#L0##bYea right. Are you sure this isn't some kind of joke?#l#k\r\n#L1##bMBI, huh? You guys suck. I hope you stay lost.#l#k" />
            <string name="1" value="I assure you it's not. We at the MBI do not have a sense of humor... at least one that we're aware of. So, here's the situation: I'm trying to apprehend a dangerous ghost who goes by the alias of Mr. Bones. I've been on his trail for a while, and just when I thought I had him, he scared the bejeezus-I mean, caught me by surpise, and I dropped my #bParanormal Activity Report#k.  Now the pages are strewn all over this place!  Crafty bugger.  My rather extensive report contained all the information I've gathered on my target's movement patterns, possible hiding spots, favorite disguises.  Without my notes, I'm lost!  Can you help me?" />

The bigger problem is I think those annoying #b#o9400556#s#k around here have been eating them!  Er... I don't know how you're going to get those pages out of them, but if I can get enough of those pages back, I can put my report back together and pick up Mr. Bones' trail again.  #b50#k more should be enough to get me back on track!" />
