        <string name="1" value="Tangyoon has been experimenting with a new dish as of late, using an ingredient that no one has ever used before. He's apparently been working with Evil Eye Tails!

Does he even know if those things are edible? \n\n#i 4000007##t 4000007#  #b#c 4000007#/40#k" />

Now that I am in Victoria Island, I plan on trying out new ingredients, you know, and that ingredient is... the tail of an Evil Eye.
