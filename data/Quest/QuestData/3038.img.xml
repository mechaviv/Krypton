        <string name="1" value="I met an old man named Huckle at the hidden room in the middle of Orbis Tower. He's been living in there for 30 years, studying the physics of the self-moving stones. He wants me to gather up #b45 Jr. Sentinel Shellpieces, 20 Ice Sentinel Shellpieces, and 20 Fire Sentinel Shellpieces#k. Alright, let's do this ..." />
        <string name="2" value="I got Huckle, the old man living in the hidden room at the Orbis Tower, the items he had requested, and in return, got the Statue-Teleporting Scroll. It allows me to teleport between the statue at the 20th floor of Orbis Tower, and the 1st floor. Huckle looks like he needs more samples, so I guess I'll need to keep looking for those ..." />

I don't even remember the last time I've seen a person. But hey, if you have some time in your hand, then can you help me out here? It's not that hard of a task, so I'm sure you can do it." />

The more visible ones at this tower are the monsters that resemble a bunch of moving stones, and I'm here to study anything and everything involving them. Conducting studies on them takes time, however, and so it is almost impossible for me to gather up the samples of them." />
