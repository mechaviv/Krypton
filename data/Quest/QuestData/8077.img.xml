        <string name="0" value="We found the 3rd Herb, but it is tightly sealed inside Lazy Buffy's Marble. It seems like it's been attached for so long, that I don't think we can just pluck it out of the sphere. Sabitrama then mentioned something like applying modern science to opening this. We've come so far, that there's no way we're about to give up.\nBut then again, who am I supposed to find?&quot;" />
        <string name="1" value="He may have talked too candidly on some things, but I think the herb can be plucked out of the marble. As part of the deal, I have to gather up #b500 #t04000133#s#k.\n\n\n#t04000133#  #b#c04000133##k/500" />
        <string name="2" value="The seal is disabled, but since the marble itself isn't very stable, Dr. Kim made a device called &quot;Open Sesami&quot; and sent it to Sabitrama. I should go see him later. \nAnyway, he's pretty good at what he does, but man he's terrible at naming his inventions!" />

            <string name="10" value="...Hmmm.\nI think I found a way to remove it, but I can't give that away for free. If you gather up enough parts for my ultimate robot, then I'll think about it. Bring me #b500 #t04000133#s#k that can be found through Dual Pirates." />
