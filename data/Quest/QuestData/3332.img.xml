        <string name="1" value="#p2111003# did not remember anything from the past. He does not even remember who created him. He did tell me, however, that he has a friend and that's why he doesn't feel alone, and that friend is #p2111005#... a tight bond between Humanoid and a Fairy? That's interesting! He wanted to give #p2111005# a present, and asked me to get #b#t4000357##k and #b#t4000358##k for him, so he can make one for her. \n\n#i4000357##t4000357# #b#c4000357##k/100  \n#i4000358##t4000358# #b#c4000358##k/100" />

            <string name="1" value="I don't remember the past. I mean, I may not even have one. I don't even remember who made me. It's just like one day, I found myself standing here.  Quite odd to merely exist, with no prior memories.  Imagine if you couldn't remember what your mother looked like?  Or your first kiss? Its strange for others to speak of this, as I have no comparable experience." />
            <string name="2" value="That doesn't sadden me, however. I am very satisfied with where I am right now. I know it sounds weird for a Humanoid to use the word &quot;satisfied&quot;, but ... that's true. I like it here. I even have a friend here, Keeny." />
