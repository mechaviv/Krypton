I was having a hard time doing all this by myself, but now that you have offered to help, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Thank you for coming." />
            <string name="1" value="After a number of tests, I came up with the conclusion that the Ghost Stumps are acting strange because of this strange puppet called a #t4032319#. This means we'll have to #reliminate #o1140130#s#k and remove the #t4032319# as well. Maybe defeating #r100#k would help you find one?" />
