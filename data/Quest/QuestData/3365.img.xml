I better find #bYulete#k, who might be hiding somewhere in #bMagatia#k." />
        <string name="1" value="Yulete made a promise that from here on out, instead of conducting experiments to be accepted by others, he's going to do it for his own satisfaction. Conducting these studies and experiments by himself seem a little difficult, though. I better help Yulete out.  #k\n\n#y3366# #b                (#u3366#)#k\n#y3367#        #b(#u3367#)#k\n#y3368#    #b(#u3368#)#k\n" />
        <string name="2" value="I was able to really help Yulete complete his experiments. He may not have been universally accepted by his peers, but he's indeed a genius alchemist. An alchemist like him is more than capable of raising the bar of alchemy in Magatia much higher." />

I've returned the items that I've stole, and I have already been pardoned by the presidents from both societies, but... I just can't make myself available again, yet. For a time being, I just want to spent my time quietly working on something new... kind of like concluding all those years spent madly working on new inventions to impress others." />

I don't know how I managed to just go ahead and conduct all those studies by myself before... Hmm... if it's alright with you, can you help me with one of them? Ah, don't worry about it. It's not going to be remotely as dangerous as the last one." />
