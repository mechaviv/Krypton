        <string name="1" value="I met with Hoony again at a field around Omega Sector. Hoony seemed to have an affinity for sweets, and it did not do his teeth any good. Now, he needed Pain Reliever to relieve the excruciating pain on his teeth. My job now is to get the #bPain Releiver#k from the Omega Sector, and give it to Hoony." />
        <string name="2" value="I purchased the #bPain Reliever#k from Dr. Pepper at the Omega Sector Silo, and gave it to Hoony, who was at a field around Omega Sector. Seriously, enough with the sweets!" />

What are you doing here? There seems to be more aliens today than there were ever before. Arghhh, ouch ouch!!! This toothache is just killing me!!! Oh, what's up? Do you want to know why I'm like this?" />
            <string name="1" value="I honestly have a severe case of sweet tooth, and I just can't spend a day without eating any sweets. I guess that's what contributed to my death being a mecca for all bacteria to ruin my teeth. In a way, it's only fair that I'm suffering from a severe case of tooth cavity. I can't go back to the base right now because I am in the middle of work, so can you do me a favor and pick up #b#t2002011##k for me?" />
            <string name="2" value="So where can you find #b#t2002011##k? Hmmm... well... who can make such thing at the Omega Sector...? Who actually sells it...? I am sorry, but I can't remember this on top of my head. Who can make it? Arrgh, this is causing major headache right now. Please help me!" />
