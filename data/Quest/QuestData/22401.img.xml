            <string name="1" value="Ride an Onyx Dragon... HOLD ON JUST A MINUTE. What are you saying? You want to...ride me? But I'm your partner, not some little pet! How could you, master...\r\n#b#L0#Don't be silly! That's why I want to know if I can ride you. BECAUSE you're my partner...#l\n#k" />
            <string name="2" value="Oooh, I get... Wait, huh?! Well, I suppose it would make things more convenient, but if I ever get tired, I get to ride on you, okay? \r\n#b#L0#What?! Are you trying to kill your one and only master?#l\n#k" />
            <string name="3" value="Fine, fine. Nevermind. I was just joking anyways. If I tried to ride on your back, you'd turn into a flat old pancake. But if you want to ride me, no problem. You're not that big.\r\n#b#L0#So it's okay for me to ride on your back then?#l\n#k" />
            <string name="4" value="Yea, why not? I can fly a whole lot faster than you anyway. But we can't just take off here and now. Two things must be prepared first.\r\n#b#L0#Two things?#l\n#k" />
            <string name="5" value="You need a saddle and the Monster Mount skill! I don't think you'd survive long on my back without something to sit on. Think you can prepare both those things?" />
