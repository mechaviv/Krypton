        <string name="1" value="#p2060005# found out that someone is trying to steal his research.  #p2060005# asked me to #b watch the wild boar#k and bring back #b#t4031508##k to him.  On top of that, he asked me to get the wild boar's #b#t4031507##k as well...I'd better stay alert for this one--I don't want someone to steal his research before I learn how to tame and ride monsters! \n\n#i4031508##t4031508# #b#c4031508#/5#k\n#i4031507##t4031507# #b#c4031507#/5#k." />
        <string name="2" value="I obtained the items and returned to the Aquarium. For helping him with his research, #p2060005# gave me the #bmonster riding skill#k and one #b#t1912000##k for the monster. It's time to travel in style! I must look in the Tiger Ridge map, there should be some rubble lying about--a hidden portal. Traveling through it will transport me to a new area with the pigs. I can use the perfume when I'm close to one to capture it. After that, I can equip the Mount and the saddle, and use my new Monster Riding skill to call the mount! I can feed my pet by visiting the Leafre Pet Food Seller, and make it stronger. Hmm...I wonder if there's a way to get a stronger mount? I'd have to be ready for the 4th Job advancement, I'll bet.." />

I want to prove that monsters can live with humans, if they don't attack them of course. That's why I show people tamed monsters. They're actually quite friendly once tamed. The tricky part is just getting them not to bite off your hand, which can be difficult, I admit. " />

However, a few days ago, these weird, yet fascinating creatures broke into my home and learned of my research! I fear what may happen if the secret gets into the wrong hands--this is not for power but for peaceful coexistence of humans and monsters. I fear that if they find my lab and then my notes, they might turn the monsters even more vicious!" />
