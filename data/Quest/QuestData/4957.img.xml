He's realized that his Toy Machine has been corrupted and is churned out twisted versions of his former creations.  Because the machine can't be destroyed, Jonas has asked me to destroy as many of his creations as possible.  For every 50 Psycho Jacks, 50 Nightmares, or 50 Sophilia Dolls I destroy, Jonas has promised to reward me with something special. " />
