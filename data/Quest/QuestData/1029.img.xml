The investment of  AP determines your power (STR), intelligence (INT), agility (DEX), luck (LUK). It can also increase your HP and MP. \n\nWhoa.. Fantastic! You learned a lot thanks to him. Sam said there is one more thing he has to tell you." />

You can choose from Warrior, Magician, Bowman, and Thief on Victoria Island. Each job has a stat requirement: #bWarriors need STR 35, Magicians need INT 20, Bowmen need DEX 25, Thieves need DEX 25#k. You should remember that and invest your AP in the proper stats of the job you want!" />

You can increase HP or MP if you want. AP is worthy as it can be used many different ways. Every class has one primary stat and one secondary stat.
