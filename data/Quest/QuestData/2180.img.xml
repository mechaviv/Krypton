They say that Tangyoon's dishes will either transport you to the happiest moment of your life or make you experience a flood-like rush of fantasy the moment you take a bite of it. What IS his secret? " />
        <string name="1" value="The secret behind Tangyoon's cooking is none other than fresh ingredients! So I guess that means that freshness is the basis of all great cooking? Tangyoon is so serious about making sure that he has the freshest ingredients that he actually raises his own milk cows on The Nautilus for milk... Now that's impressive! Tangyoon wants me to go milk the cows and bring him some milk if I want to try some of his newest dish. Well, I definitely want to try some of his food, so I guess I'll go milk the cows and fill this bottle with milk. I'd better remember that I can only fill up 1/3rd of the bottle from a single mother cow.  \n\n#i4031850##t4031850# #b#c4031850##k / 1" />
