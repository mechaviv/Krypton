        <string name="2" value="Just the way the Roly-Poly Worker 5 asked, I took out the drumming bunnies and collected the toy drums. He said his work got easier when I'm around, and he wants me to help him out on some other stuff. Maybe I should chill here and help these guys out for a change. " />
