            <string name="0" value="Perion has been steadily deteriorating these days. It seems barren to begin with because of the rocky landscape, but it's also because of the recent excavation project that has been affecting areas around Perion. The sheer digging only speeds up the deterioration. I, for one, would like to restore Perion to its previous, glorious days. Would you like to help me out?" />

Recent reports suggest that a mutant version of the Stumps, #r#o1140100#s#k, have been roaming around the area. " />
                <string name="1" value="After studying the #o1140100#, I learned that if the tree brances on the top of Ghost Stumps' heads are planted on the ground, they will grow into huge trees. It's kind of like #t4000195#. Please head to the excavation site and eliminate #o1140100#s, while gathering up #b54 #t4000195#s#k for me. I'll surely appreciate it." />
                <string name="2" value="#o1140100# appears quite often around the excavation site. The way to get there is quite simple. Head all the way East until you reach #rRocky Road III#k. There, you'll see a portal at the very top. Enter the portal to head to the excavation site." />
