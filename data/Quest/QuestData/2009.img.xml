        <string name="1" value="Under the watchtower at Henesys Park, you see Pia, who's wearing a teddy bear costume. How cute. She tells you that she ran into a bully Blue Mushroom on her way to Ellinia and now she wants you to show the mushrooms who's boss! So collect #b40 blue mushroom caps and 40 green mushroom caps#k as proof. But, er, isn't she just asking to be teased, walking through the forest in a costume like that?" />
        <string name="2" value="You delivered #b40 blue mushroom caps and 40 green mushroom caps#k to Pia in Henesys Park. She was thrilled that she got vengeance on the mushrooms and gave you a scroll for defense. All you have to do is click on it in the Use tab of your Item Inventory and drag it to your helmet in the Equipment window...but what if the scroll fails?" />
