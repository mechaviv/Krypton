        <string name="1" value="I found Ayan, and she seemed to be in a state of panic. She was walking around the swamp when she ran into a bigger, stronger, and more dangerous group of alligators than the previous ones. She ran back to Perion and had been looking for me ever since, so I could help her out once more. This time, I'll need to kill #b120 #o5130103#s#k and take #b50 #t4000033#s#k along the way. \n\n#o5130103# #r#a20951##k\n#t4000033# #b#c4000033##k/ 50" />
        <string name="2" value="I took out 120 #o5130103#s from the swamps, just like the way Ayan asked me to. I'll have to revisit that spot from time to time and take out the alligators before they spawn out of control." />
