        <string name="1" value="Icarus had failed to create a working Hang Glider, and is now attempting to create a flying balloon on his never-ending quest for flight. This looks just as preposterous as his last attempt, but I don't think I can stop him. To make the flying balloon, he needs #b100 #t4000035#s#k and #b10 #t4031164#s#k. Hope this works...\n\n#t4000035# #b#c4000035##k/100\n#t4031164# #b#c4031164##k/10" />
        <string name="2" value="I got the materials needed for #p1052106# to make the flying balloon and realize his dream of flying. I don't know if his &quot;flying balloon&quot; will indeed fly, but there's a chance that it may indeed work. I'll check up on him around the time when the flying balloon should be ready to take flight and see if he's for real this time." />
