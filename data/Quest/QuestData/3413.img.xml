        <string name="1" value="I met with Black Mesoranger again at a field around Omega Sector. She wanted me to take out #bChief Grays#k, considered as a high rank among the Grays, as well as collect 3 of their #bnotes#k from them. Chief Grays are very rare among all Grays and they are few and far between. How am I going to find them? \n\n#t4031102# #b#c4031102##k/3" />
        <string name="2" value="I took 3 #bnotes#k from the Chief Grays and gave them to Black Mesoranger, who was at a field around Omega Sector. Apparently, these notes contain the history of the Grays... hopefully these notes can be deciphered soon!" />

            <string name="0" value="You're the one that helped me get rid of #b#o4230116##k the other day at the Kulan Field, right? The research on the force controlling them is just about to be concluded, and it's taken longer than expected, but I'm glad you're here now. I have something else to ask you for a favor. Will that be alright? Would you like to at least take a listen?" />

                <string name="0" value="Thanks a lot. I told you about the class-driven nature of the Grays, right? I finally found the high-ranked Gray that is in charge of this area, and it's called #b#o4240000##k. It was hard to find them, because there just aren't many of them." />

I better start tightening up, or I may lose my place here! Anyway, thank you for the job well done. I know this isn't a lot, but please take it!" />

                <string name="0" value="Thank you so much. Now, let's try to decipher this note. Just as I thought, this is written in alien language, so it's near impossible to understand what's written here, but with a little time, I'm confident that we can decipher this book. I gotta get this going, so I'll see you around!!" />
