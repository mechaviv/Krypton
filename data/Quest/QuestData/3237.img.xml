        <string name="1" value="I met up with #p2041019# at the Toy Factory in Ludibrium Clocktower. Rocky seemed to be swamped with work due to a sudden increase in monsters destroying parts here and there. He was worried about running out of essential parts, so he asked me if I could gather up #b50 cogs#k and #b30 screws#k. .\n\n#t4003000# #b#c4003000##k/30\n#t4000115# #b#c4000115##k/50" />
        <string name="2" value="At the Toy Factory in Ludibrium, I gave Rocky the cogs and screws needed for him to fix anything that is broken. Hopefully that was enough to undo the damages done by those pesky monsters." />
