            <string name="0" value="I noticed the monsters have been unusually aggressive lately, but a monster like that... this is out of my league." />
            <string name="1" value="Oh have you seen it already? That monster residing in the snow valley?" />
            <string name="2" value="I tried hunting for that monster yesterday to protect this town from being attacked by it, but I ran into that werewolf monster. I actually felt like I may die right there on the spot." />
            <string name="3" value="Ahh... there's nothing a hunter like I can do about it. Unless fighting is a way to make a living, there's no way you can handle that monster. Say, looking at you, you seem well equipped to fight it... \nHey! Don't tell me you are about to take on that monster!" />

                <string name="1" value="It's a werewolf monster much like a human being in that it walked in two's. I ran into it at night, so when I lit a torch, all I could see were a set of intimidating eyes, along with 7 sparkles that flashed around the neck area." />
                <string name="2" value="Now that I think about it, I heard that one of the soldiers who happened to just walk into town got attacked by the same monster. Foxy... no, Fox! Yes, that Fox fella. Master Sergeant Fox. Ask him, and he'll give you the details on that monster. " />
