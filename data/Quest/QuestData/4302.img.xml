Hmm...I don't get why she'd want to wear a muffler in such warm weather, but I did promise to get her #t4000066#s, She needs 100, so I'd better get started. So, that's #b100 #t4000066#s#k... \n\n#t4000066# #b#c4000066#/100#k" />
        <string name="2" value="I gave #p9120001# 100 #t4000066#s. Hmmm, but this isn't as much as I thought. Can she really make a muffler out of this?" />
