That's interesting. Say, if you aren't really busy and all, can you please do me a favor and plant the seed on the roof of our house? I am sorry, but I haven't had anything to eat for the past few days, and I am too tired to go up there. If the seed turns into a gourd later on, then can you do me another favor and open it and give me what's inside? Thank you." />
