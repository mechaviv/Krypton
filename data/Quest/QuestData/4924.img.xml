        <string name="0" value="Looks like the Glimmer Man is looking for a rare material from the alternate dimension of Versal, the very #b#t4031760##k that I now possess.  Perhaps I should visit him in New Leaf City and see what he wants with it.  Maybe he'll reward me for bringing him some..." />
        <string name="1" value="I visited the Glimmer Man, and discovered that he's an ultra-powerful mage whose ability to turn his entire body into pure diamond (hence his name) has allowed him to journey to space and other inhospitable environments.  Through the vast knowledge he's acquired during his explorations, he's also become somewhat of a renowned weapons creator and arms dealer.\r\nThe Glimmer Man has landed in Masteria looking for something called #b#t4031760##k, a rare element from the alternate dimension of Versal he's been dying to experiment with.  To thank me for recovering some and bringing it to him, he's promised to make me a weapon of my own from it. However, I've got to also track down #b7 #t4021008#s#k and return these to him as well.  Only then can he reduce the naturally unstable Materia down to a useable form.  A weapon made from an otherwordly material! I wonder what it does..." />
        <string name="2" value="I returned to the Glimmer Man and he synthesized the #b#t4031760##k and the #b7 #t4021008#s#k I gave him to form a Materia Orb.  He's said his precocious friend Spindle can turn this into a weapon, so I should see him when I'm ready to make the weapon...WOOT!  Spindle is currently residing in the Omega Sector.  Additionally, anytime I find more White Versal Materia, I can bring it to the Glimmer Man and he'll create another Materia Orb for me so I can make another weapon!" />

            <string name="0" value="Greetings. How's it going?\r\n\r\n#b#L0# Er... who are you and why do you look so... different?#l" />
            <string name="1" value="Why, thank you!  I am called the Glimmer Man...and yes, there are few like me in this world.  I am a mage of some power, a traveler of land and space, and a scholar of the universe and its many mysteries.\r\n\r\n#b#L0#That's quite a funky jacket you have on.#l\r\n#L1#Yeah, whatever... freak.  Powerful mage?  A space clown is more like it!#l#k" />
            <string name="2" value="Stylish, isn't it?  I made this jacket myself.  Might look a little weird, but the purple markings are actually enchantments. They make this particular coat highly resistant to magic. Not that I really need it anymore anyway... \r\n\r\n#b#L0#Why is that?#l" />
            <string name="3" value="Do you see my skin?  I am called the Glimmer Man because I can turn my body into pure diamond with a mere thought.  No, it was not something I was born with...it was a skill I learned.  My diamond form renders me impervious to magic, as well as having quite a number of other handy effects.  In this form, I've been able to survive in outer space and journey through the cosmos.  I have seen and learned much in my travels...much that most men and women have never seen, nor will ever see. \r\n\r\n#b#L0#Why are you here? Surely a mage of your power has better things to do...#l" />
            <string name="4" value="After leaving the realm of Ellinia where I began my training, and having exhausted my avenues of learning at an early age, I traveled the distant reaches of space for many years in search of new things, new ways to improve on my abilities as a magician.  Other than a few not-so-amicable run-ins with the Grays, it turns out that space is...well, mostly made of space.\r\nJust when I had despaired of finding new frontiers to explore, I heard that Masteria had appeared off of Victoria Island, emerging from the depths of the sea!  The tales of this place had always intrigued me-this land is rumored to be where those come to find their destiny; or in other words, gain greater power.  I had heard legends of the Grandmasters of the fabled Crimsonwood Keep, how they were without peer in their chosen professions.  Exactly the sort of place I'd been looking for to extend my knowledge!  Who knew that that such a place would be on the very planet that I'd left?  And as luck would have it, one of the very things I had searched for in space has been found here!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#What are you looking for exactly?#l" />
            <string name="5" value="In my pursuit of power, I have become a weapons crafter by trade.  I design all kinds... from handheld armaments to star-breakers on battle cruisers.  Years ago, I came across a very rare element called #bWhite Versal Materia#k. I had only a small sample of it but even in that small amount I saw the potential of the material!  It could be used to create weapons of tremendous power!  I studied it extensively, and drew up many schematics for weapon designs.  But alas, I did not have enough of the material to actually construct any of these weapons.  I had thought that it was a material found in outer space, and truth be told, one of the primary reasons why I journeyed into the far reaches of the galaxy was to find more.  But from what I've learned, it's not even from this world!  Rather, it's from an alternate dimension of the Maple World...a world called Versal!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Whoa!#l" />
            <string name="6" value="Imagine my amazement upon my arrival in Masteria when I began to hear that adventurers here have been finding it!  I've already devised blueprints for a new line of hand-held weapons using this rare element!  The designs are exquisite...but unproven.  If I only had some White Versal Materia!  Should you find any, please return it to me!  In exchange for allowing me to try out and perfect my designs, you can keep the weapon I create.  Deal?" />
