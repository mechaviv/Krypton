Hmm... hey there, I like you a lot, would you be my Valentine? Hmmm, that doesn't sound like me either... whoa, were you watching me the whole time? That was embarassing. What was I doing? Well... I actually took a liking to this girl not too long ago, and I want her to be my Valentine, but I don't know how to say it. The problem I have right now is that I am stuck here, doing my work, and I can't go visit her right now. Can you do me a huge favor, just this one time?" />
