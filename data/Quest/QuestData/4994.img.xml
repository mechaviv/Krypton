        <string name="0" value="There's a little girl with a puzzled look on her face in New Leaf City.  With X-mas time just around the corner, she should be happy... I wonder why she looks so puzzled and confused instead?  Looks like she may need some help with her Maplemas spirit!" />
        <string name="1" value="Little Suzy was all excited for Maplemas this year... until she learned all about a similar holiday called &quot;Versalmas&quot; from a strange green mouse named O-Pongo.  Now she doesn't know what sounds more exciting - Maplemas... or Versalmas?  Suzy needs my help to help her decide which version of X-mas she should celebrate this year.  In order to do that, I'll have to speak to both Maple Claws and this O-Pongo character, and then come back and talk to her.  Maplemas holiday from an alternate dimension, huh?  Very curious..." />
        <string name="2" value="I spoke to both Maple Claws and O-Pongo.  It seems that both Maplemas and Versalmas have their merits.  In the end, Suzy's put the decision on me: she's asked me to deliver her X-mas Wishlist to one of the two &quot;Santas,&quot; which will determine which holiday she's celebrating this year.  I have a feeling that this decision is important, that I'm not just making a choice for her... but also one for myself.  Which holiday do I believe in?" />

There's no such thing as Versalmas!#l#k\r\n#b#L1#Listen, little girl, I've got more important things to do than answer stupid kid questions.#l" />
            <string name="1" value="I'm not little!  I'm 10 years old!  And there is too such a thing as Versalmas!  O-Pongo told me all about it!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#O-Pongo?  Um, right... I suppose this &quot;O-Pongo&quot; is your invisible &quot;friend.&quot;#l" />
            <string name="2" value="No, silly! O-Pongo is real! In fact, he's right in Happyville this year...go look if you don't believe me!  He's just like Maple Claws except he's big and green and a mouse and wears purple instead of red!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Ok...#l" />
            <string name="3" value="Well, maybe he's not exactly alike, but he's the Maple Claws from his world -- the world of Versal!  O-Pongo told me all about it!  He told me about how it's usually dark but that the sun shines day after day after Versalmas comes and how all the kids dance and sing together and get special treats and candies!  It sounds very exciting--more exciting than Maplemas!  Well, maybe not more-- I do like all the presents I get from my parents on Maplemas.  But you get presents for Versalmas too!  I was already going to ask Maple Claws for a new pair of skis and other stuff, but I don't know what kind of presents since I've never had Versalmas before... so maybe Versalmas presents are even better!  But Maplemas Trees are so pretty and I love decorating them!  So-- Oh, I don't know!  Both holidays sound so good but I don't know if I'm allowed to celebrate both...\r\n&lt;looks sad&gt;\r\nPlease... can you... can you help me decide?  You're older than I am... you should know!  Pleaaaaase!" />

I'm sure you know this already but you can get to Happyville by speaking to #bRooney#k, and she'll take you there.  Then come back and tell me which holiday I should celebrate!  I've been working on my wishlist all year long and I know I'm going to get everything on it because I've been a really good girl!  Please, hurry!  I need to know who's bringing me presents this year!\r\nI can't wait to hear back from you!  Both holidays sound so great!  I can't wait to celebrate, uh--the right holiday!" />
