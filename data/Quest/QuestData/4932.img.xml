        <string name="1" value="Grendel The Really Old was talking out of himself but I got to make him hear what I had to say. He is getting glasses. I hope his eyesight isn't too bad to recognize Bob... After all, Grendel is probably the oldest guy in this world." />
        <string name="2" value="Grendel The Really Old got very mad at me for hitting Bob to make him go into his shell. I knew he would know something but never would have guessed they were old friends. I guess I owe Bob a big apology. But how am I going to be able to do that to a snail, especially if he's not coming out from his shell?" />

            <string name="3" value="Bob is one of my oldest and dearest friends. I've seen him since I was little child so he is probably just as old as I am. We talked a lot. Subjects of those chats were mostly about this universe and our purpose of life. We've shared a great deal of thoughts until one day; he decided to pursue ascetic life with solitude. It's been a while since then. I didn't know I would see him like this though.\r\n\r\n#L0##bAh... I see.
