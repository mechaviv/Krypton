I had been working on something for a while, and I had been seeing progress lately, so that's why I didn't go outside for a long time. What? You want to know what I am doing? Hmmm... how am I going to say this..." />

That's exactly what I have been working on these days. How do I get that to work? Hmm...while I was wandering around the area, I ran into a 'Crack of Dimension'. Its a slight crack where time gets warped and distorted. I am utilizing this distortion to travel to wherever, whenever, at any time." />

And you said you've met me before... but this is the first time I've ever seen you! Wait, come to think of it, that key...that key...how did you end up with that? What? You're from the future?" />
            <string name="2" value="You've received a key from me...and you know of my future...maybe you really came from the future to see me. It's hard to believe, but...what do I do in the future? For you to tell me that this will ultimately succeed...my heart is now racing into overdrive! I'm going to work so hard to finish my curl might come off!  Perhaps we shall meet again..." />
