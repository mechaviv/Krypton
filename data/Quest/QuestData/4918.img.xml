        <string name="1" value="I spoke with Icebyrd, and he was glad to see me. He's been trying to build the new areas, but the Gryphons have been wreaking havoc on the construction crews. If that wasn't enough, those pesky Boomers are also attacking the machines. I've agreed to help by taking out #b100 Gryphons#k (located in the Highlands) and #bBoomers#k for #b150 #t4000391##k (located in the Badlands) to show them that this city is off-limits!  " />
        <string name="2" value="Man, what a day. I de-clawed the Gryphons and defused the Boomers. Now the city can continue building in peace. Icebyrd said that they may act up again, so I should come back to see if they've been rowdy..." />
