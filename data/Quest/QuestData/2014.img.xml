            <string name="0" value="Hey, hear me out. A couple of days ago I ran away from home to get away from my very straight-laced father. So here I am, in #m103000000#, just wandering around. I've spent all the money I secretly took from my dad's safe, and to be honest, I'm sick of this. I shouldn't have run away." />
            <string name="1" value="I don't think my dad will just let me walk back in the door... Not without beating the bejeebus out of me. Can you find a way to calm him down? I need your help, man." />

My father has a LOUD personality, so you can't be too submissive when you talk to him. I'm sure you'll figure something out." />
                <string name="1" value="To prove you've gotten my father calm enough, ask him for the #t4001003#. The #t4001003# was my mother's before she passed away. He always said he'd never give it to a guy like me, so if he does... It means he's forgiven me. I'll be waiting!" />
