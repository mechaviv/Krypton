As a sign of thanks, she gave me #bscroll for shoes for speed#k. Since there are other items that can be found at #bconstruction site B3#k , maybe I should head back in there sometime..." />

Someone I know asked me for a favor and get him 100 #t2000004#s. He gave me the money to buy them all, so I put that sack of money in my pocket, carrying it with me. It was way too heavy, though, so I dropped it on the ground, only to have the bottom of the sack wear off and have a hole in the end. The money fell down because of it ... Can you find them for me?" />

Don't be fooled by his appearance; he's got quite a temper ... argh ... pleeaasssee help me! Please help me find the sack of money!! You're the only one I can count on right now!" />

This may be difficult even for you this time around. Anyway please please please get that sack of money for me. I believe in you..." />
