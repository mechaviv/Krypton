Luckily, he has plenty of #t4031507# and he will make me another #t2270000# if I bring him #b#t4031509##k.\n\n#i4031509##t4031509# #b#c4031509#/1#k. I'd better hurry back--I want my new mount!" />

Seems ridiculous to me, the perfume smells like hot feet and onions--unless you don't like the person, then I could understand why you'd use it! Another mystery solved!
