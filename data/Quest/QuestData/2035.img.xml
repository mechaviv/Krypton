The Snake Drink back then is gone now because his mom drank it all...anyway, Luke was ready to quit the boring life of a security man and wanted to travel...and to make a glove that befits the traveling, Mr. Smith of Perion suggested #b1 black feather, 10 Orihalcon Plates, 50 dragon skins, 40 screws, and 3 horns of Taurospear!!#k That's insane...well, I'm guessing he wants me to collect them for him...oh, do the fairies of Ellinia know something about it?" />
        <string name="2" value="I got Luke all the materials he needed for the nice glove, and return, he gave me a very precious item that has been passed down from generaition to generation, an #bold bronze normal Helm#k. I feel like I'm losing out on this deal...but I can't get mad at him since it's been passed down from generation to generatoin. I heard Mr. Thunder can make this helmet even better...I should go there sometime later.." />
