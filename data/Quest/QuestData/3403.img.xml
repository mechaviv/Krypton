Hoony said that he fixed #bGunny's Laser Gun#k that he was asked to fix and requested me if I could give him his #bLaser Gun#k as well as show him the Blueprint Machine. He should be somewhere around the Field. Where could he be..." />
        <string name="2" value="Hoony wanted to show the Blueprint to Gunny. He was already on his way to give Gunny a new weapon, so he asked me if I could give him the new gun, as well as show him the Blueprint. After much searching around, I was able to finally find him and gave him the gun." />
