After I showed him the ring, he conceded that he may have an item that'll provide enough clues to help me ultimately find the Book of Ancient. Of course, he also didn't want to just give it away like that. Since he's spent too much energy trying to help other warriors, he wanted #b2 Power Crystals#k to recover his strength, in return for handing me the item that holds the clue." />
