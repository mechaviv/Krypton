            <string name="0" value="Anyway, since you're here and all, I would appreciate it if you take some time to listen to my story. One day, I was walking around the back alley when, out of the blue, a creepy individual crept up to me and stole my purse! I reported it to the police, but I don't think they've found it yet. You'll see a man in front of the police station, and his name is Popo. Can you ask him about the purse for me? I can't go right now because I'm in the middle of work." />

The backalley thugs have been running rampant, and I've been so busy that I feel like asking anyone for a backup. Please tell Mariwaka to wait a little bit more. Now, if you can excuse me..." />
