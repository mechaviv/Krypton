Chumji advised that I drop the baits at various spots near the abandoned house in the Black Mountain to draw the Goblins out, and proceeded to give me the details on exactly where to drop them: roasted pork in front of a stack of rocks; buckwheat paste inside a tree hole; rice wine in a stone lantern?\n\n#o7130400# #r#a36113##k\n#o7130401# #r#a36111##k\n#o7130402# #r#a36112##k\n#t4031232# #b#c4031232##k/1\n#t4031233# #b#c4031233##k/1\n#t4031234# #b#c4031234##k/1" />

It'll be near impossible to find them just by looking at them, you know; Goblins are very good at hiding from human sight. I'll ask you this one more time: Are you sure you can handle this? This is not going to be easy." />

                <string name="0" value="Very trustworthy. Hahaha... Okay, now I'll teach you how to draw those Goblins out. The #bYellow King Goblin#k is a Goblin that gets easily frightened like a chicken. It's the Goblin that once was so scared by the cracking sound of a hazelnut bite that it ran without picking up its own bat. Now, this Goblin is a big fan of pork, so if you head over to the abandoned house and place roasted pork on a stack of rocks near the house, it'll show up for sure." />
                <string name="1" value="Next up is the #bBlue King Goblin#k, who is prone to forgetting things here and there. This Goblin manages to lose things quite frequently, once even losing the Goblin Hat. Some petty thief picked it up and tried stealing other things, until he got caught by the people and got heavily punished for it. This Goblin prefers #bRice Wine#k. There's a #bStone Lantern#k around the abandoned house; pour the Rice Wine in it, and it'll surely come out of the house." />
                <string name="2" value="Last, but not least, the #bGreen King Goblin#k likes to engage in some Korean Wrestling. There are times in the middle of the night where it'd pop out in front of an unsuspecting soul in the middle of the night, and engage in Korean Wrestling, wearing the person out in the process. This Goblin is very fond of #bbuckwheat paste#k, and if you place it inside the #btree hole#k at a tree near the abandoned house, it'll surely appear." />
