Why are you paying attention to that? I mean no one knows where it's hidden. Anyway, what? you have #b#t4031438##k?" />
            <string name="1" value="Come to think of it, you must be the traveler that ventured into the lair of Lord Pirate. In that case, I'll let you know what happened. All those jewelries that have been accumulated by Lord Pirate roaming around Ossyria, those jewelries are hidden somewhere on the ship. It's called #b#t4031551##k." />
            <string name="2" value="It's incredible that you've defeated Lord Pirate, but it's hard to tell where the jewelries are based on looking at the map. It's encoded, so no regular person will be able to read it. If you promise me one thing, however, I'll be more than happy to chip in on translating the commands. What do you think? Do you want to do it?" />

Since I have enjoyed the beach before moving permanentlyh to #m251000000#, this should be a piece of cake. As for #t4031551#... right inside the ship is a #bthe deck where the bellflowers are guarding#k. Apparently, that's where it is." />
                <string name="1" value="Lord Pirate seems to be a hard guy to handle. Looking at this travel log, it looks like the only way the box can be open is through a key held by Lord Pirate, so I think we'll need to receive #b#t4031437##k from Lord Pirate, and investigate #bLord Pirate's lair#k. With this much info, we'll be able to find #t4031551#." />

Thanks to Lord Pirate living nearby, the poor residents suffer as a result. Hopefully those treasures will aid in their path towards recovery. You promised!" />
