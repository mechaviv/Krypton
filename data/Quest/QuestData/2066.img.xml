        <string name="2" value="#b#p1022006# the Archeologist#k in Perion said that it is not safe to put the valuable fossils in his tent. He asked me to deliver it to #bDr. #p1032104##k in Ellinia. Dr. Betty said it is going to be really busy from now. He asked me to stop by again and give him a hand afterwards. Fossils huh...? Should I give it a try?" />
