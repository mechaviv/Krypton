Phew... that's a relief. It's good to know he is healthy and all, but he sometimes gets into trouble while traveling around the sea." />
            <string name="1" value="I don't know where he is now, because he moves around too much looking for adventures. However, I do have a letter sent from him to me recently. I can show you the letter to you if you'd like." />

                <string name="1" value="Hmm... but he wasn't a bad person at all. Quite funny, in a... strange, sort of way. Underneath the fuss, he was intelligent and wise also. I've heard he got #bMano's Shell#k. Maybe the shell that made him like that? Still, he was a fair guy for a human being." />
