        <string name="0" value="I've heard tell that many travelers get lost in the spooky Phantom Forest.  If I come across any of them, perhaps one of them will have an interesting tale to tell about the area.  I should search them out, but I better make sure I don't become one of these lost travelers myself... yikes!" />
        <string name="1" value="I met a knight lost in the Phantom Forest named #bLukan de Vrisien#k.  His armor is very ancient-looking, and he seems to be from another era.  Lukan asked if I knew anything about the unfriendly #bStormbreaker#k warriors wandering the forest.  He seems to hate them, though strangely, his armor looks almost exactly like theirs... lightning bolts and all!  Regarding this, Lukan remains tight-lipped... at least until I prove I'm not in league with them.  To gain his trust, and prove my fighting prowess, I need to #bdefeat these Stormbreakers#k and #bcollect 10 of their badges#k to bring to him.  " />
        <string name="2" value="After defeating the Stormbreakers as he requested, Lukan explained that he is a #bStormcaster Knight#k from Crimsonwood Keep.  When I told him that Crimsonwood Keep was ancient history, and that Masteria had been lost for a millenium, he seemed at a loss for words.  Somehow, he has been transported to this time period, his future.  Strange things are brewing indeed." />
