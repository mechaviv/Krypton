        <string name="1" value="I went back to Elpam for more information, and he's explained that while he was able to adjust the compass, he needs to head back to the moment of his travel glitch to get back to his home safely. I have to hunt down #b60 Temporal Fragments#k and hand them over. That's a full minute and the perfect amount of time for him to travel back. The Tick-Tock monsters should have them, since they tend to keep time. HA!" />
        <string name="2" value="I got all #b60 Temporal Fragments#k and returned them to Elpam. In return, he's given me a very nice prize he found floating in the rift...!" />

Doing so will allow me to go to my intended place and get home as normal. However, I'll need #b60 Temporal Fragments#k to give me enough time to do it. I believe the creatures you refer to as Tick-Tocks will have them, although it is a rather rare item. I will remain here until your return." />

No, 3 months...out of one...what do you call them...year? I believe that is the correct measurement.
