We do not have a concrete evidence for that as of yet, so we need to dig for more information. Well, even if  you do, you won't be able to face off against the Puppeteer with the level you're at right now, so I will most likely withhold from giving you the assignment anyway. I'll see you when you reach #bLevel 18#k." />
