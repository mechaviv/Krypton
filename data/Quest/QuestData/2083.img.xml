        <string name="1" value="I got to meet #b#p1052106##k on top of a building at Kerning City. He seems like a nice guy who has an unquenchable thirst for flying, and he wants to create a Hang Glider to fulfill his dream of flying. He asks me if I can gather up the materials for the Hang Glider, and even though the process of making the Hang Glider seems dubious at best, I can't say no to his sincere desire to fly. I'll need to get him #b50 #t4000042#s, 10 #t4003001#s, and 50 #t4003004#s#k.\n\n#t4000042# #b#c4000042##k/50\n#t4003001# #b#c4003001##k/10\n#t4003004# #b#c4003004##k/50" />
        <string name="2" value="I got the materials needed for #p1052106# to make the Hang Glider and realize his dream of flying. I just wonder if Stirge's wings are enough to make the Hang Glider. I don't know if this will really work, though, so I'll check up on him around the time when the Hang Glider should be ready to take flight." />

That got me thinking, in order to fulfill my dream, I should make a huge hang glider! I read it in a book, and it says we can fly like a bird with the hang glider in place. All I need now is a set of materials needed to build it, and ... do you want to help me out here? If you get me the materials, I'll definitely let you ride on it. What do you think?" />
