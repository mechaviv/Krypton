A warp capsule that takes the person to the Omega Sector regardless of the place of origin? That's awesome!! I want to take it myself for a split second, until I found out that only the Omega Sector members can use it. Darn it..." />
        <string name="2" value="Kay needed help from me, since he couldn't send the rescuers to save Robinson, and so I got the specially-made warp capsule and gave it to Robinson. Now he can go back to the Omega Sector and get himself fixed." />
