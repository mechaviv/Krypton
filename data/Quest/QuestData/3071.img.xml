It's not something you should be aware of ...? \nWho told you of it???\r\n#L0#Someone around El Nath told me about it, and also told me of #b#t4031218##k.#l\r\n#L1#I randomly heard of it while traveling. I want to learn about it too, in hopes of something important like this will help me on my future hunting endeavors.#l" />
            <string name="1" value="Hmmm ... I don't know how you found out about it, but ... I think #b#t4031218##k is really a terrifying force. You've done your share of traveling, and I suppose you've never seen any monster that is supposedly dead, but still moves around as if it's alive, like #b#o5130107##k and #b#o5130108##k. They shouldn't be roaming around as if they're alive, but they are, thanks to #b#t4031218##k. It's the very force behind those two and other &quot;undead&quot; monsters moving around as if they're alive. " />
