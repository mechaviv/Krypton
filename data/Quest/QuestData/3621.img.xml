        <string name="1" value="I went to visit Kong Ji again. She was sitting down, looking dejected. Her stepmom ordered her to plow the field by lunch, but her wooden hoe, which had been used for years and years, finally coudln't handle the pressure and snapped. Kong Ji felt that only a durable steel hoe can help her plow the field, so I have decided to get #t4031222# for her. I heard that I can obtain the #t4031222# by eliminating the Blins, who reside at the Black Mountain... \n\n#t4031222# #b#c4031222##k/1" />
        <string name="2" value="I found a way to acquire #t4031222# through Blins at the Black Mountain, and gave them to Kong Ji, who still seemed devastated by the 'snapping' of the wooden hoe. Needless to say, she was ecstatic when given the steel hoe. She was thankful for my work, and went out to start weeding the garden.. Kong Ji's been through a lot; hopefully something good happens to her down the road." />

From what I hear, some Blins that reside in the Black Mountain possess steel hoes. Unfortunately, I am not strong enough to get close to them, nevermind going up against them. You look strong enough, though, so please help me acquire #b1 #t4031222##k through the Blins." />
