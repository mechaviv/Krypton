        <string name="1" value="#p2041004# said he's been concerned about a mysterious, anonymous letter sent to the king of #m220000000#, and believes something huge is developing. He then asked me to head over to #b#m100030000##k and find out who wrote the letter..." />
        <string name="2" value="There's a huge wooden entryway leading into #m100030000# which I'd never seen before. It almost looks like an entryway to a fortress... I should try talking to #p1094000#, who was standing in front of me. I remember him telling me that a #bpirate #p1072008##k fort is being built here.  I wonder who the captain is..." />

Only he knows exactly what's written on it, but I think it's a note that signals the arrival of a #bnew force#k to be reckoned with. The king announced to us that we'll become their allies." />
                <string name="1" value="That being said, I still can't shake this feeling of concern. I want to know exactly who wants what, and honestly, I have no clue. All I know is that their arrival will signal a new, earth-shattering change in the Maple World. What else have they brought with them?" />
                <string name="2" value="The king told us not to worry, but I think it'll be better for us to investigate on our own. I would like for you to head to Victoria Island and go up to the #bEast forest of #m100000000##k and see what's really going on there. Thanks in advance!" />

We use Knucklers and Guns to make sure that the root of all evil is vanquished--we want to make sure that the Black Magician never rises to the heights of power as he did before." />

We're not aliens or anything like that! We're just Pirates.  Fearsome, fight-to-the-last-man, potion-loving Pirates! Don't tell me you are thinking of Lord Pirate and those despicable bandits.

If you want to join us and #p1072008# and become a mighty  #bGunslinger or Brawler#k, come back later. By then, we'll be ready to accept you with open arms, and train you to live the life of a Pirate!" />
