        <string name="1" value="Old Man Tom told me about the haunted Prendergast Mansion.  Apparently, the doors won't open for just anyone... I've got to figure out how to get in.  Tom mentioned that the toymaker Prendergast used to hold parties for kids for holidays, including Halloween costume parties around this time of year.  Maybe if I wear a costume I can get in!  Hmmm... Now where can I buy one?" />
        <string name="2" value="I made it into the old Prendergast Mansion, against the advice of Old Man Tom.  I wonder why he's so dead set on keeping people out of the house?  Maybe if I explore the house, I can find out more about what happened here..." />

            <string name="0" value="You want a word of advice about the house?  STAY OUT OF THERE!  It's haunted!\r\n\r\n#L0##bA haunted house?  That sounds like a perfect place to explore for Halloween!#k#l\r\n#L1##bWhy would I be interested in a boring rickety old house?  See ya later, you crazy old coot...#k#l" />
            <string name="1" value="What?  Are you daft?  What's wrong with you young 'uns these days?!  Let me tell you why you won't be wanting to go in there!  This house used to belong to a Master Toymaker named Jonas Prendergast.  Jonas used to make marvelous toys... dolls that danced, stuffed animals that walked and talked!  Every kid wanted a Prendergast toy for Christmas!\r\nTo keep up with demand, Jonas built a marvelous Toy Machine at the top of his house to automate his toy creation process.  Children from all over Maple World used to come here to see his creations and beg their parents to buy them-- and Jonas would hold lavish parties every holiday for them.  As a matter of fact, right around this time of year, every year, Jonas would have an elaborate Halloween party, giving away toys instead of candies for the trick-or-treating kids, but only for the ones who came with costumes of course!\r\n\r\n#L0##bA toymaker's house?  That doesn't sound very scary.#k#l\r\n#L1##bHow do you know all this?  I don't believe you.  I'm tired of your story, old man!#k#l" />
            <string name="2" value="Don't interrupt your elders!  I'm not done telling you the tale.  So... as I was saying, that was before a terrible tragedy befell the family!  Despite being married many times over, Jonas only had one child... his beloved daughter, Sophilia, whom he loved with all his heart.\r\n\r\n#L0##bSo something happened to her?#k#l" />
            <string name="3" value="One night, an accident befell Sophilia, a terrible accident.  They Say that the death of his darling daughter unhinged Jonas... and grief drove him mad.  Jonas stopped making toys, shut down his Toy Machine, and withdrew from the world, locking himself in his workshop at the top the house.\r\n\r\n#L0##bSo what happened to him?!#k#l" />
            <string name="4" value="That was a long, long time ago.  No one has lived in the house for years.  But they Say that even now, you can hear the Prendergast Toy Machine, chugging away, continuing to crank out his toys, toys that have become twisted with his anger and sorrow.\r\n\r\n#L0##bOooohhh, now that sounds kind of scary...  So how do I get in?#k#l\r\n#L1##bHow do you know all this?  I don't believe you.  I'm tired of your story, old man!#k#l" />
            <string name="5" value="What?  What's wrong with you?  Didn't you listen to my tale of woe?  The house is HAUNTED!  It's DANGEROU-- Hmph... what's the use?  No one listens to an old man!  No matter... The house won't let just anyone in.  Thank the heavens!  So even if I knew... I wouldn't tell you!  But some of you rascals have managed to get in... looking for trouble I'm sure, like all young 'uns do!  Now, scat!" />
