It wasn't that he was much less of an oaf, he was actually quite odd, but at least he showed some measure of respect. Speaking of whom, I recall seeing Master Jonas's ghost in the Toy Room just the other day...and all these other ghosts started appearing as well, shortly thereafter. Perhaps you would care to talk to Master Jonas and request him to release the father?" />
