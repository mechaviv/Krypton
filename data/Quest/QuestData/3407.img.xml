                <string name="0" value="Thank you for making some time with me. I have heard that someone's been looking for the boxes, but I didn't think much of it, until one day, the Boxes of Parts disappeared totally. The Boxes of Parts have been stolen, and I think it's the work of the aliens. Maybe they were just worried about the possibility of our new robot controlling their livelihood." />
                <string name="1" value="The one good thing is that, thanks to the automatic-returning device I attached to all the boxes, even the most intricate of the responses will generate a signal that'll enable us to locate where the boxes are located at. They may have broken the device, but I don't think they completely destroyed it. The Boxes of Parts are hidden at the Boswell Field. Go there, and you may find a box that looks like that of the aliens. Your task is to destroy that box and bring back the Box of Parts." />

I'm sure the... 3aliens made your way back a little more difficult that it should have been... you really must be something special. How about joining us and working here full-time as a member of the Omega Sector? Hahaha... anyway, great job there. Since you worked so hard to make it here, I'll give you some more spare Warp Capsules. Please take this." />

I better make sure to attach these Boxes of Parts with the newest automatic-returning device! It would be terrible to have these stolen by the aliens, again.
