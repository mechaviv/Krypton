He said that I would find the Singing Shield there.  However, he said #m910500200# would be locked so I would have to eliminate #o9500139# to get the key....Will I really get Sayram's shield there? The Insignificant Being tells me to try taking the key I already used for another world to #b#p2040052##k as well...This is getting interesting, I'd better keep my weapon close! \n\n#i4031471##t4031471# #b#c4031471#/1#k\n#i4031475##t4031475# #b#c4031475#/1#k" />

This WAS the great warrior Sayram's skill! I have learned a new technique! Quite unexpected but excellent nonetheless. I shall use this in battle to defeat my enemies!" />
