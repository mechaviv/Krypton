        <string name="1" value="While aimlessly walking around Sky Forest, Tae Soo was ambushed by a terrifying wild bear. Almost injured, Tae Soo completely froze up, not knowing what to do, until a helping hand arrived...by the form of bear. Tae Soo wanted to know what that bear was all about, and asked me to talk to #bNo Gong#k about him." />

            <string name="0" value="The animals that inhabit around Mu Lung are unlike any other animals in the world. A great majority of them are equipped with intelligence and dilligence, as they train to become Master. Of course, every once in a while, you'll run into a few that will act up on their instincts and attack humans. I ran into a bear like that a while ago at the Sky Forest." />
            <string name="1" value="I was stunned when I was attacked, because Sky Forest is normally a peaceful place. Its long, sharp claws were ferociously swung literally inches from my eyes. Then, something incredible happened. A powerful force fired by someone took out the wild bear and rescued me, but..." />
            <string name="2" value="The one that helped me wasn't a human, either. He actually looked even more ferocious than the wild bear... he was #ba Hulking Bear with a Scar on His Eye#k. I found myself controlled by fear once again. He looked like he was going to use me as his lunch pale, but... he just turned around and left... without saying a word... without acknowledging my 'thank you'." />
            <string name="3" value="I feel terrible that he may have felt offended by my response, even though I was more than grateful for his help. His attire suggests that he may be one of the bears training to become the Master at Sky Forest... who must that be? If it's okay with you, can you do me a huge favor and find out what he's all about?" />
            <imgdir name="yes">
                <string name="0" value="Ahh... thank you. From looking at his uniform, he may be one of the students of #bNo Gong#k. Pretty much everyone around here that's involved in physical training is a student of No Gong, so... that's my guess. Please go see No Gong and ask about him. Thanks!" />
