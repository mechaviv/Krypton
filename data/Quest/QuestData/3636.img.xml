        <string name="1" value="I met #b#p2071010##k, who was heavily sighing at #m222010002# with a big lump on his head. Apparently, he got hurt from a random axe that was thrown on his way. After throwing the axe out of the pond in disgust, the owner of the axe, #b#p2071011##k, came and asked for the axe. He requested that anyone that finds the #b#t4031315##k return it to #p2071011#.\nThe Mountain God believes that the steel axe for the tree cutter might be taken by a monster, and that he has offered to look into the axe and see if it's legit. The axes will be available through #rDark Axe Stumps#k, and he'll look into it and see if it's really #b#t4031315##k." />
        <string name="2" value="Through the request from #p2071010#, who I met at #m222010002# of the Black Mountain, I returned #t4031315# to its rightful owner, and received the storybook on 'The Story of the Axes'." />
