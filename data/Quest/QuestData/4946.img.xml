        <string name="1" value="I spoke with Ludmilla, and big surprise---her Cherry Pie Ghoulash didn't lure Jonas out. I think he probably pushed a bookcase in front of the door to ensure he never sees her again, but that's just a theory. At any rate, it looks like now her prized jewelry has mysteriously disappeared. She thinks Sophilia's taken it, but I'm not sure if I buy that, seeing as how she's...not around to do that. I have to gather #b20 #t4031769#s#k and #b10 #t4031770#s#k and bring them back to her.  The woman complains way too much... sheesh. " />
        <string name="2" value="I found Ludmilla's beloved jewelry for her.  In return she gave me a worn, but well-loved doll. It's seen better days, but it has charm. Someone is probably looking for this..." />

Well, I must Say, the days have not been kind to your face.  Have you tried a cleansing facial mask?  Or a paper bag, perhaps?\r\n\r\n#L0##bWhatever, Matilda.

After being ignored for so long, I've had enough.  Being a good wife is for the birds. And I've tried so hard!  So, rather than take care of a man who only sees the forest for the wooden toys he obsessively creates, I've decided to simply live the life of luxury he owes me---I'm his wife after all. \r\n\r\n#L0##bEr, congratulations?\r\n#L1#You know something?
