        <string name="0" value="I keep hearing the groans and bellows of machinery echoing through the house.  What is making this racket?  Is it where these infernal toys are coming from?" />
        <string name="1" value="I found Jonas Prendergast in his Toy Workshop at the top of the house, in front of a huge toy machine which seems to be the source of all these infernal toys!  It seems that his machine is not functioning properly.  If I collect #b50 Firewood#k, #b25 Screws#k, and #b25 Loaded Springs#k, Jonas can build the replacement part to get his machine working properly again.  I know that the Rocking Horses will have the #bFirewood#k and the Psycho Jacks will have the #bScrews and Loaded Springs#k.  I've got to get what Jonas needs-perhaps this will stop it from churning out all these crazy toys!" />
        <string name="2" value="I collected the parts Jonas needed to fix his machine.  I hope I haven't simply helped a madman create more of his messed up toys." />

I must continue to make more... for the children.  Unfortunately, I've run into a bit of a jam.  Where is Edmunds when you need him?  Edmunds!  Hmmm... maybe you can help me?\r\n\r\n#L0##bUm, sure.

You should've seen the smoke!  It's a good thing I wasn't sucked into the machinery!  That would have been very nasty.  In any case, I finally figured out what's wrong... yes, yes, one of the Assembler Actuators must have gone kaput.  I'll need to build a replacement to get the machine working properly again.  Only thing is, I don't have the materials to it.  Say, think you can help?" />
