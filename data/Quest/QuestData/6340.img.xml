One of the benefits of the skill is that it will strengthen me and give me a body of steel! I'd better go observe the Red Dragon Turtles whose bodies are equally as hard, and try to stand up against them. To prove that I've done the training, I must defeat #r150 Red Dragon Turtles#k and bring #b50 Hearts of Stone#k to Kyrin. \n\n#i4031872##t4031872#  #b#c4031872# / 50#k \n#o8140701#  #r#a63401##k " />
