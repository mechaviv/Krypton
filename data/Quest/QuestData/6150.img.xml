        <string name="1" value="#p2040052# talked about a warrior named #bSeram#k. He mentioned a singing shield which I can use to get information about the old techniques of Sayram.

Should be an amusing trip at the least. A singing shield? I wonder...   \n\n#i4161019##t4161019#  #b#c4161019# / 1#k" />
        <string name="2" value="Tatamo seems to know about Sayram, however, the singing shield is another matter. I wonder if this is all true or just some kind of joke...perhaps I should talk with Chief Tatamo again." />
