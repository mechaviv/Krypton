It may be a #p2071006#, but it was smart enough to talk in human language, and also casted spells, albeit very little. Birds like that are hard to find, and it should be pretty famous by now. It used to be just another regular #p2071006#, but after raising the bird by feeding some Peaches and #t2022143#, it became one very intelligent bird." />
                <string name="1" value="#p2071006# may look like a baby bird at times, but it's very intelligent and kind-hearted, allowing it to fly across the world handling some of the most important informations around. Even at its busiest, it always dropped by to say hello to me, but now it's impossible to contact #p2071006#. If you, by any chance, run into #p2071006#, please let him know that #p2091001# misses him." />
