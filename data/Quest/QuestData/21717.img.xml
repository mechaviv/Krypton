            <string name="0" value="Apparently, #rthe kid carrying the puppet#k appeared in the Southern Forest again. It's definitely reliable information since #p1032112# was the one that said it. When the kid entered the dungeon, he had a #t4032317# with him, but after he left, he no longer had it. I'm sure it has to do with making the #o1110100#s violent again." />
            <string name="1" value="It'd be nice to find the one that's responsible for this, but #p1032112# said that the kid literally shows up everywhere, so catching him red-handed will be difficult for now...but that doesn't mean we are going to let the #o1110100#s behave like that. We must recover the puppets so we can bring peace back to the Southern Forest. Will you please help us?" />
