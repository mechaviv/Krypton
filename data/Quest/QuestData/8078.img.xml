        <string name="2" value=" I think, as soon as the seal was disabled with the 3rd Herb, it perished the moment it touched the open air. Sabitrama seemed content with it, but ... I must admit, he's one heck of an enthusiast in terms of herbs. 1,000,000 mesos was a stiff price to pay, but I got the Magic Collection, so I'm good with that!" />
