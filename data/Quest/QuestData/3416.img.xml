I was expecting her to tell me that she's been waking up on time, only to find out that all of her clocks have been destroyed. She said she needed a special alarm clock, and to make it will require #b2 Special Batteries, 10 Cogs, and 10 Table Clocks#k. To obtain the special batteries, I'll have to defeat Master Robo at the Ludibrium Clocktower.\n\n#t4031115# #b#c4031115##k/2\n#t4000114# #b#c4000114##k/10\n#t4000115# #b#c4000115##k/10" />
