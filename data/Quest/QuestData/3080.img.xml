        <string name="1" value="#b#p2060005##k, a veteran animal instructor at the Aquarium Zoo, seemed to be concerned over the fact that the animals at Aqua Road have been acting strangely since the storm that occurred not too long ago.

        <string name="2" value="I gave #p2060005#, the animal trainer at Aquarium, the DNA samples of some of the animals at Aquarium. If it's indeed true that some animals have started to act differently since the storm, then how is he going to prove it through research? I'm anxious to find out..." />
