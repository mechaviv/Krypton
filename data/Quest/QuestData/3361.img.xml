He wanted me to acquire #b#t4031774##k for him, and in order to do so, I'll have to find someone that is aware of #p2112014#'s current whereabouts... \n\n#i4031774##t4031774# #b#c4031774##k/1 " />

            <string name="0" value="Hey, do you know of the name Yulete by any chance? He's apparently very famous around Magatia, but infamous would be a better word. He was conducting this questionable research that was highly ridiculed by everyone, I even heard that his own pets told him his ideas were bad. We're talking about moon-powered sunlamps, dehydrated water in a box, lint staplers, the works.  If it was useless, he invented it. It was strange, he used to be a prodigy.  By the time of his last great failure, which I believe was a portal napkin holder, he went into seclusion." />
            <string name="1" value="I mean, the point Yulete was trying to make was outrageous. I mean, he proposed that the work of Zenumist and Alcadno should be combined for a synergy effect. That definitely made him many enemies from both Zenumist and Alcadno." />
            <string name="2" value="That being said... people are curious to see how that research and the following experiment turned out.  He did have one idea that was rather good.  I am sure he failed, and that's why he hasn't set foot in Magatia since, but... I'm getting curious, you know. That's why... I'd like you to get me his Lab Report. " />

                <string name="0" value="Excellent. I don't know where Yulete may have disappeared, but those that admired him claim he can still be found somewhere around Magatia, so enter Yulete's lab through those people, fight the monsters around the area, and get me Yulete's lab report. Thanks!" />
