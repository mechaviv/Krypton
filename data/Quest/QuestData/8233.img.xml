        <string name="1" value="I spoke with LIta, and it seems that there strange, powerful spirits drifting about the Phantom Forest. These strange spirits seemingly have no desire, save for tormenting others. I've agreed to eliminate 30 of them, and bring their soiled rags to Lita as proof of valor. I'd better keep sharp-that forest has driven quite a few travelers mad with its confusion..." />
        <string name="2" value="I navigated the Phantom Forest and collected 30 of the Soiled Rags the Elder Wraiths had upon them. It was strange to finally fight one, they were eerily quiet for being so vicious. I wonder if there's more to their story...perhaps someone in the Phantom Forest would know..." />
