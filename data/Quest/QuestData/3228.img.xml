        <string name="1" value="After defeating a bunch of #bMateons#k at the Boswell Field, I went through their stuff and found 5 #bMemory Pieces#k that contained Korin's lost memories. I gave them to Agent Marco, and he proceeded to put the 5 together into one whole piece of #bKorin's Memory#k. Now all I have left to do is give this piece of memory back to Korin." />
        <string name="2" value="I gave Korin her lost memories through the man in Omega Sector wearing black suits, #bAgent Marco#k. She was initially disoriented after recovering her memories, but she promised to fully enjoy life the way she used to before the kidnapping. Hopefully that'll never happen again." />

Did you like the small reward I gave you for your hard work? Use that scroll on the hat / helmet you're currently wearing, and it'll significantly improve its stats. Thank you so much for helping me out. Good bye." />
