            <string name="0" value="Are you here to join Alcadno? I don't know if you truly know what Alcadno is about. Alcadno may be one of the groups that studies alchemy, but... we are not only creating new things through magic, we are formulating ways to incorporate machinery into the union of magic and science. Do you still want to join Alcadno?\r\n#b#L0#Yes, I want to join Alcadno.#l" />
            <string name="1" value="Hmph. Another one willing to enter the treacherous, abandoned path of science. Desire alone will not bring you in Alcadno, however. The report alone will not cut it, either. True skills of alchemy cannot be determined by looking at a document. I will be asking you some questions to determine whether you are qualified to become an Alcadno or not. Understand?\r\n#b#L0#Understood.#l" />
            <string name="2" value="Alcadno is always looking for ways to turn machines into a form of life. These efforts have yielded multiple forms of mechanical dolls, ready to be tested.

Here's the question... which ore is used as the source of power to get the mechanical dolls to work?\r\n#L0# #bBlack Crystal\r\n#L1# Silver\r\n#L2# Summoning Rock\r\n#L3# Lidium" />
            <string name="3" value="Machine dolls that use Lidium as the source of energy can be controlled by the Magic Pentagram. In order to make the basic equation that allows the Pentagram to control the movements of the machine dolls, then what would be the best book to use for this? If you have ever studied as an alchemist, then you should know this in an instant.\r\n#L0# #bBasic Mana by Grendel the Really Old\r\n#L1# Robeira's Introduction to Magic\r\n#L2# Jane's Guide to Alchemy for the Beginners!\r\n#L3# Alcaster's Compilation of Alchemy&lt;Beginner&gt;" />

            <string name="5" value="..you are much smarter than I thought. Here's the last question... unlike Zenumist, Alcadno's area of studies is not yet fully accepted by the public, which means you'll run into a lot of obstacles along the way. Even with all that, are you still confident enough to conduct studies with the pride of Alcadno in your heart?\r\n#b#L0#Of course.#l" />
