        <string name="1" value="#p2094000# used to be the chamberlain of the King of Bellflowers. According to him, the Bellflowers never attacked humans and lived peacefully. That was, before Lord Pirate kidnapped #bThe King of Bellflowers, #p2094001##k. The Bellflowers, worried that #p2094001# might be in danger, reluctantly followed the Lord Pirate's orders and started attacking humans.instead. How cowardly of the Lord Pirate to disturb the peace of the Bellflowers by kidnapping their King!! That's despicable! I better defeat #r#o9300119##k and save the King of Bellflowers, #p2094001#! \n\n#o9300119#  #r#a38131##k\n#o9300105#  #r#a38132##k\n#o9300106#  #r#a38133##k" />
        <string name="2" value="I was able to defeat #o9300105# and save #p2094001#, the King of Bellflowers. Hopefully, with the king now saved, the Bellflowers will resume their peaceful lives." />
