        <string name="1" value="At the entrance of Henesys Park, you met Alex's father Stan, the chief of Henesys. He was even more blunt and difficult to talk to than you'd anticipated, but you finally convinced him to accept Alex back with open arms. You also got Alex's late mother's #bgold watch#k as proof. Now, all you need to do is get this watch to Alex in Kerning City." />
        <string name="2" value="You gave Alex his late mother's #bgold watch#k. As a sign of appreciation, he gave you an earring he received from friends he met while traveling. Well, Stan forgave Alex, but it doesn't seem like Alex plans to head home right away. Maybe you should keep an eye open next time you're in Henesys." />
