        <string name="1" value="Rooney felt bad that most Maplers don't believe in Santa Claus anymore. She also mentioned that this is caused by the loss of #bSanta Encyclopedias#k in the town library. She asked that you gather all 6 Santa Encyclopedias that the monsters have stolen. Remember, not only is it meaningful to gather all 6 Santa Encyclopedias, but also something good will happen while searching for those books.\n\n#t4161043# #b#c4161043##k/1 \n#t4161038# #b#c4161038##k/1 \n#t4161039# #b#c4161039##k/1 \n#t4161040# #b#c4161040##k/1 \n#t4161041# #b#c4161041##k/1 \n#t4161042# #b#c4161042##k/1" />
        <string name="2" value="Just like Rooney had mentioned, a lot of good things happened to you while searching for the 6 Santa Encyclopedias. Since you did all those good deeds, Santa is certainly coming to town. More importantly, Maplers will now believe in Santa Claus!" />
