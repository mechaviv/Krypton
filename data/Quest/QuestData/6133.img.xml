He wrote stories about ferrying those who died to the underworld; but yet returned, somehow brought back to life. As I continued to read, I noticed a familar name. It was #b#p1061011##k of #bSleepywood#k... #p2060100# told me I could find out about the secrets of death if I meet those who returned from the grave. There is a secret here that I must discover!" />
        <string name="2" value=" #p1061011# knew about Caron as #p2060100# said. It appears there is a way to learn how to bring back the dead back to life. Such a technique would certainly come in handy during encounters with dangerous monsters. I must learn it!" />
