        <string name="1" value="In front of Sleepywood Hotel, I met #bSabitrama#k, a medicinal herb trader who seems to be the younger brother of Chrishrama. He said he found a place where he can finally find the herb that he needed for this medicine he's working on...and that he asked if I could go in that forest and grab an herb called #bPink Anthurium#k. It consists of green grass and a small pink flower ... I better remember this well and get him the exact same one. I heard the place is near Ellinia ... I should go there and talk to this guy #bShane#k ..." />
        <string name="2" value="Thankfully I got the flower that Sabitrama wanted from the Forest of Patience, and as a sign of appreciation, he gave me a #bscroll for the overall armor#k. Oh, and he also said that from here on out, I can enter the Forest of Patience without having to pay Shane of Ellinia. Based on what I've heard, the diet medicine Sabitrama's working on is for Shane's fiance ... I better get back in the Forest of Patience when I have some time ..." />

            <string name="1" value="Actually I've found a place where you can find good medicinal herbs. It's at a forest not too far from here ... lots of obstacles around the area but I can tell in the end there will be goods available for us to use ... so what do you think? Do you want to go there in place of me?" />

I heard someone's accepting an entrance fee at the entrance ... you have the mesos to go in, right? Sorry but I've spent all my money traveling so I'm afraid I can't help you on that ..." />
                <string name="1" value="Yes! I'll explain to you about the herb you'll be getting for me. Remember there are similar herbs around so make sure you know this. The herb you'll need to get is #b#t4031020##k, and the flower looks like this #i4031020#. Look carefully and please get the same one as I described for you." />

            <string name="1" value="Oh, I almost forgot. Since you helped me out, I should thank you for your hard work. Here, take this scroll. My brother made this for me a while back, and it adds to the guarding abilities of the armor. Hopefully you'll use it well. And from here on out,  #p1032003# will let you in free.
