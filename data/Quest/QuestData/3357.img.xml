        <string name="1" value="#p2111001#'s eyes normally scare me off, but his eyes seem sad today. According to him, #p2111003# was found at #p2111002#'s lab when the lab exploded because of the failed experiment. No one knows when or how it was made... and Humanoid himself doesn't remember his origins. \n\nMaybe #p2111002#'s experiment didn't fail as everyone believes... the one item that #p2111003# is holding on to, despite not remembering anything from the past, says it all. I better go to #b#p2111005##k and give her #p2111002#'s piece of mind." />
        <string name="2" value="#p2111005# seemed stunned when receiving the medicine, but then turned into pure joy and happiness. #p2111005# seemed determined to get better with the medicine, so she can really improve her alchemy skills to one day turn #p2111003# into a human being. Hopefully her experiment will end up being successful." />
