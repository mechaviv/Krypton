He's got a passionate hatred for Wolf Spiders, as one bit her just as she was giving him a kiss. So, I've agreed to hunt down 100 Wolf Spiders in return for his thanks and something special he picked up. I should be able to find them in the Temple Hive..." />
        <string name="2" value="*Phew* I wiped out 100 of those pesky Wolf Spiders, and in return, I received a Leaf Crystal from Jack Masque. I can come back every 72 hours to help him if I want. I wonder what he did to get kicked out of Amoria...? " />
