I guess I won't be able to obtain the Antidote Marble with the Sage Cat by negotiation. There's no other way now... I'll have to take it by force. I'll have to eliminate the #rKing Sage Cat#k and obtain the #bAntidote Marble#k! \n\n#o7220002# #r#a38441##k  \n#i4031789# #t4031789# #b#c4031789##k/1." />
        <string name="2" value="After defeating the King Sage Cat, I grabbed the Antidote Marble and gave it to Do Gong. Fortunately, the marble was legit, and Do Gong seems to have been cured from poisoning. I better make it a habit of not being so gullible against others with suspect motives." />
