        <string name="0" value="I obtained a book I can't read. It looks like it's written in a strange language. The writing is crude, almost like an animal wrote it...a kind of monster language. I wonder if #b#p1022002##k would know how to read it. Couldn't hurt to speak with him..." />
        <string name="1" value="My hunch paid off. When I asked #b#p1022002##k about the book, he examined the language closer and came to a conclusion. He said the book is about the #bRush#k skill. He offered to translate, but he said that I must prove myself as one worthy to obtain such power--a true warrior in his eyes. I must eliminate #r200 #o9300087##k in #m910500100# located at the entrance of the Sanctuary, deep in Sleepywood. Manji saw that I was surprised by the high number and advised me to make a party with a few of like-minded companions to ensure victory. This is precisely what friends are for...\n\n#o9300087# #r#a61101##k" />
        <string name="2" value="With a bit of help from my trusty weapon, I easily defeated the requisite number that #p1022002##k requested. As promised, he translated the book, and it revealed the famed skill known as Rush. I can't wait to try it out!" />
