The problem is, this book is so powerful, I can't do it on my own. I know it's forbidden to do what I'm about to do, but...to seal it up, I need an item that possesses awesome magical power." />

It's been forgotten for years, but lately I have heard that the ore of the crystal can be obtained through monsters with dark powers in them. That can only mean one thing: the evil thoughts within those monsters are expanding by day. It's definitely not a good thing..." />
