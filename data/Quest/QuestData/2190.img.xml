A strange rumor has been swirling throughout Victoria Island, and a lot of people are concenred about it. If you are a traveler yourself, surely you must have heard of the rumor by now. That there's a #bgroup of suspicious people#k seen around the Eastern shores of #m100000000#." />
            <string name="1" value="From what I hear, the suspicious group of people roam around in weird costumes and carry unusual weapons. People say they hear sounds coming from the shores. It's really puzzling. Could you investigate this for me?" />

We're not aliens or anything like that! We're just Pirates.  Fearsome, fight-to-the-last-man, potion-loving Pirates! Don't tell me you are thinking of Lord Pirate and those despicable bandits.  They suck!  We serve a cause much more true to the spirit of Victoria Island!" />

If you want to join us and #p1072008# and become a mighty  #bGunslinger or Brawler#k, come back later. By then, we'll be ready to accept you with open arms, and train you to live the life of a Pirate!" />
