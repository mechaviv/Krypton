        <string name="1" value="At the Korean Folk Town, I met with #b#p2071009##k, who's a loving father to his only daughter, Shim Chung. Lately, however, he's been worried that his eyesight is rapidly failing him, and that he was worried he might one day become blind. He wanted to buy a pair of Reading Glasses, but the astronomical price tag calls for #b300 #t4031279#s#k per pair, he wanted to borrow them from me. How am I going to find #t4031279#, though?\nAhh, Mr. Shim said I can find it through #r#o3210208##k at #bHelios Tower#k... \n\n#t4031279#  #b#c4031279##k / 300" />
        <string name="2" value="I ran into #p2071009#, who was concerned about his rapidly failing eyesight, at Korean Folk Town. After hearing his story, I promised to lend him 300 #t4031279#s. The problem is, I don't have any rice ... but thankfully, after gettin #o3210208#, I was able to get 300 #t4031279#s. As a sign of thanks, #p2071009# gave me #t4031280#." />

            <string name="0" value="How can I help you? My name is Cantsee Shim, or #p2071009# for short. I live here in Korean Folk Town and I live with my beautiful daughter Shim Chung, my precious only child. Have you seen her by any chance? She has been busy going to places, and I haven't seen her in a while. I am worried about her whereabouts. Where could she be ...\r\n#L0##bDo you want me to help you find her?\r\n#L1#Mr. Cantsee Shim ... so are you completely blind?#k" />
            <string name="1" value="No. My last name is  'Shim', and my name is 'Cantsee', but it's just the name, nothing else. Believe me, people always inquire about it, and that's why I just go by Mr. Shim. As I have gotten older, however, I am legitimately concerned about my rapidly declining eye sight. \r\n#L0##bHow about trying on a pair of glasses? #k" />
            <string name="2" value="Yes. I also went to the market a while ago, and I heard of this new item called the 'Reading Glasses'. The merchant told me this item is for everyone who has grown old and whose eye sight is slowly declining, struggling to see what's right in front. I mean, this item is just perfect for me! After finding out the price, though, I was devastated. \r\n#L0##bHow much was it? #k" />
            <string name="3" value=" I don't know why it's so expensive... I mean, #b300 #t4031279#s#k? Our family has been struggling to put food on the table, so that price tag is definitely too overwhelming. I can't let my daughter know of this, because this will greatly upset her; she's just a pure angel, she does not want to see her daddy struggle like this. Because of that, I haven't told her of this.\r\n#L0##bWell, then forget about it.\r\n#L1#May I help you in this?#k" />
