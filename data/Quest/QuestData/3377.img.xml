Hmm, looking at your eyes, I can tell you're not lying. Fine, I'm going to fall for this one last time, and I'll sell you a recipe. Do you want to buy one right now?" />

I've got the market cornered!  Once you have 20,000 mesos ready, let me know.  I'd hurry if I were you, who knows, maybe the meso will inflate, and I have to charge a few million mesos tomorrow instead of 20,000..." />
