        <string name="2" value="Wow... Bruce told me that Bob's age is incalculable. This is getting serious, isn't it. A snail that even professional monster researcher can't tell the age. Maybe he was right about asking me to go see Winston. Maybe an archeologist knows more about the history and the age issue than Bruce." />
