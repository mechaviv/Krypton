        <string name="1" value="Rolonay thinks that he'll have to rely on some openings between Papulatus' dimensions to transform through space and time. But that won't be as easy as long as Papulatus is around! Rolonay suggests defeating Papulatus to find a clue that might lead to finding the openings between dimensions. I should defeat #rPapulatus#k and look for #bany strange or special objects#k to help Rolonay with his research.    " />
        <string name="2" value="When I defeated Papulatus, I received a strange key. I gave the key to Rolonay, thinking that it might actually be a crucial piece of clue." />

This is obviously not an easy task..." />
