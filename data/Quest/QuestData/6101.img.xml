It revealed information about the bowman's ultimate skill!  What could that be? It sounds powerful...I should go ask #b#p1012100##k. \n\n#t4161024#  #b#c4161024# / 1#k. " />

I related the entire tale of the ink restoring the pages, and how #p2040052# mentioned it was made with invisible ink to prevent knowledge of this technique from spreading into unworthy hands. She has agreed to take a further look into the book to find out more. " />
