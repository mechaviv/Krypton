            <string name="0" value="I became interested in a region called Neo City and began my research about the monsters who reside there. It didn't take long before I noticed a peculiar monster called Iruvata.&#xD;&#xA;" />

                <string name="0" value="Yes, what I witnessed through my thick lens made me think twice. It was Iruvata, a monster whose speed was incredibly fast. My burgeoning interest in the creature led me to conduct in-depth research.&#xD;&#xA;" />
                <string name="1" value="How is Iruvata capable of such speed? That was the question I sought to answer. I would spend countless long nights researching until one night, when I finally discovered something amazing... The speed and strength of Iruvata are derived from its android gears!&#xD;&#xA;" />
                <string name="2" value="I don't know which programmer invented it, but it was really something else! I didn't stop there, though. I continued my research to determine whether anyone can move as fast as an android, only to realize that...&#xD;&#xA;" />
                <string name="3" value="I had discovered a way to build a memory chip that can replicate the android gear! And I'm not going to stop now. I'm thinking about conducting more research.&#xD;&#xA;" />
                <string name="4" value="If you want to make android gears, you should talk to T-1337, who isn't too far from here. I'll email him and let him know that you'll be coming to see him.&#xD;&#xA;" />
