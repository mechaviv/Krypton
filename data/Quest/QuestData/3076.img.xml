        <string name="1" value="#b#p2060100##k flat-out claimed she couldn't predict the future, but she said she can at least see what the person in question is doing right now. She also said that since the spell is really difficult to pull off, so I'll need to gather up the items if I want to find out what's in store for Gail. She requested that I get #b3 #t4031256#s#k and #b10 #t4031251#s#k from #r#o8140600##k, and #b1 #t4031253##k that can be obtained through #r#o8510000##k while it's dying. \n\n#t4031256# #b#c4031256##k/3\n#t4031251# #b#c4031251##k/10\n#t4031253# #b#c4031253##k/1" />

I warned those fools of the treacherous path they are taking, but they refused to listen. Anyway, in order to find out exactly what you want to find out, I'll need some items along the way. They are rare items to begin with, and trying to find them may even cost your life. What do you think? Do you still want to find out about Gail?" />

It's such a difficult spell that unless I have the absolute correct list of items, the chance of failure will be high. Since you have shown the desire to find out about Gail, now it's up to you to gather up the items." />

Second, I need #b10 #t4031251##k. #b#t4031251##k is very small, and they float around the water, so they'll be hard to find, but they can also be found inside the old chests that are sunken to the bottom of the ocean." />
                <string name="2" value="Lastly I want #b1 #t4031253##k. This is a sound that this gigantic fish that lives inside the underwater cave makes as it perishes.
