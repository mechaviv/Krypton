        <string name="1" value="#p2094000# had a plan to release the Bellflower that were being treated as slaves to the pirates. Unfortunately, he couldn't do it by himself, and asked me if I could go up to the pirate ship and defeat #r200 #o9300117#s#k and #r200 #o9300118#s#k. There are many different types of pirates under Lord Pirate, and the ones in command act differently from others. Apparently, they only make a quick appearance, then disappear. I better remember how they look, and eliminate the right ones. \n\n#o9300117#  #r#a38121##k\n#o9300118#  #r#a38122##k" />
        <string name="2" value="I was able to defeat the #o9300117#s and #o9300118#s at the pirate ship. Unfortunately, there are still plenty of pirates, and Lord Pirate is still alive and well. Wiill this be enough to save those Bellflowers?" />
