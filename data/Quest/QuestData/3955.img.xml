            <string name="0" value="Did you hear the story? Recently, a huge sandstorm swept across Sunset Road in Nihal Desert. The path that connects Ariant to Magatia disappeared completely for a whole week. Even the residents there claim it was the biggest sandstorm they'd seen in a hundred years." />
            <string name="1" value="After the sandstorm passed, I checked to see how it affected the creatures and discovered something amazing. A Pyramid! A giant Pyramid standing right before my eyes!\nI think it's a Pyramid that used to be buried underground but resurfaced after the sandstorm drastically changed the landscape. The local residents claim the Pyramid is evil and don't go anywhere near it." />
            <string name="2" value="But I disagree with them. An evil Pyramid? That doesn't make any sense! So I decided to enter the Pyramid and study the basics of the ancient burial process. But someone stopped me in my tracks, saying that I was not qualified and that I would only enrage some god known as Nett." />
            <string name="3" value="Apparently, only people over Level 40 are allowed in. Unfortunately, I am only at Level 39. This is why I am suggesting that you venture inside the Pyramid. What do you say?" />
