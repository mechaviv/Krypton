        <string name="2" value="Once I gave him all the #t4000298#s needed for this, #p2090004# gave me a book that he authored, #b#t4161030##k, and told me if I bring this book to him when I visit him, he'll make the medicine for me in a heartbeat. He may not seem trustworthy, but I don't see what's wrong with asking him for a medicine every once in a while..." />
