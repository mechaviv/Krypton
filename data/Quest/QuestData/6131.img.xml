A strange, but effective way of hiding the infromation contained within. The information has to be important if someone went through all this trouble. She's agreed to help me. I must gather  #b5 #t4000008#, 50#t4000081#, and 100#t4000150##k to make #t4001108#  which is needed to burn cold flames. Can I trust this witch?

Books and items such as these are too dangerous to open with normal means. In this case, the contradiction method you can use would be a cold fire.
