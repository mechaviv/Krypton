I am not saying it's literally built over the lab. I'm saying that all alchemy-related studies in #m261000000# are... based on the studies of the Black Magician." />
                <string name="1" value="Of course, that doesn't mean they are working on evil spells like the Black Magician.

The truth must be told... to make sure his name emerges clean and free of rumors and scandals, if nothing else..." />
