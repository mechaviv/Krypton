        <string name="1" value="I met up with Mac the Mechanic at the Toy Factory in Ludibrium. Mac was panicking because of the fact that all the blueprints and #bMaintenance Manual#k of the factory were stolen by Toy Trojan. If I destroy the boxes around the Toy Factory, I may find a hidden path that'll lead me to a clue." />
        <string name="2" value="I found the documents Mac the Mechanic lost, and he seemed very much relieved by it. Something's strange, though. Why would the toy soldiers feel the need to steal this in the first place...?" />

Well, the stuff I need to work with went missing a few days ago. What I lost were the blueprints for the machines in this factory, as well as documents detailing the references I need to fix the machines." />

                <string name="2" value="The secret path can be reached by destroying the boxes of the toy factory. If you open up a box inside the secret path, then you'll face a bunch of #b#o9300011##k coming right at you. One of them will cough up the #b#t4031130##k. I know you can do it!" />

If you use it, those buys will come out and cause a scene, so you may want to be at a quiet place where you can be ready to handle it. Again, please be careful with it." />
                <string name="1" value="Let's see the documents ... thankfully, other than a few, the rest are all in here. The ones that aren't here, probably the ones that stole the manual lost it on their way out. I can't do anything about that. I can make another one. Thank you so much for helping me out. I'll see you around." />
