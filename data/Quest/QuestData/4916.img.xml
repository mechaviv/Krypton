        <string name="1" value="I spoke with Elpam Gorlab, and he's a traveler from Versal, the mirror-world of MapleStory. He traveled here to observe us and our celebration, but due to the appearance of Amoria, he was thrown off-course and landed in New Leaf City. I've agreed to help get him home by collecting #b30 Elpam Magnets#k. He's mentioned that the only creatures that have them here are the Barnard Grays. I'll have to head to Omega Sector and track them down. I didn't know that there was a mirror-world...I wonder if I have a double there..." />
        <string name="2" value="I got the #b30 Elpam Magnets#k and returned them to Elpam. In return, he gave me an Elpam Elixir, something that's sure to help me. It looks like he needs more help though..." />

            <string name="1" value="Ah. Therein lay the tale of my current predicament. I am from Versal. It is best described as a parallel dimension to the Maple World, as many things are different, yet familiar. I travel here for certain occasions to observe the people that inhabit this land. However, this time when I traveled here, I noticed that I was in a strange place. In speaking with the one called Icebyrd Slimm, I discovered my calculations were off due to the appearance of the new land, Amoria. I need to get home, but I have to adjust my enchanted compass first. I will need 30 Elpam Magnets to do this properly?I believe the Barnard Grays are the only creatures in this world that may have them. I have translated this to your Quest Journal from my native language. I wish you luck, and shall await your return! \n\n#L0##bTell me more about your world, Versal.#k\n#L1##bNo way. You smell like old cheese!#k#l" />
            <string name="2" value="It can be thought of as the mirror dimension for the Maple World. There are similarities, but many differences as well. For instance, you may have noticed my last name is a monster here. In our world, they are benevolent creatures, and it is a mark of honor to be associated with them. It seems strange to me that they are so fearsome here... Would you help me?" />
