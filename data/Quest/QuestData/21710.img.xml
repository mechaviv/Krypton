        <string name="1" value="#p1012111# says that the reason for the #o1210102#'s strange behavior may be the ongoing conflict, and a potential war, between the #o1210102#s and the #o1210100#s. He asks you to look into the #o1210100#s as well and to gather #b50 #t4032340#s#k to aid his research...\r\n\r\n#i4032340# #t4032340# #b#c4032340# / 50#k" />
        <string name="2" value="#p1012111#, who studied the #t4032340#s, came to the conclusion that the #o1210100#s are not properly prepared for combat, which of course threw out the whole theory of a possible monster war. He then asked you to stop by later since he'd like some time to come up with another hypothetical theory to explain this mess." />
