        <string name="1" value="Kriel, a proud owner of a set of wings, was blowing off travelers that weren't fortunate enough to have them. I don't think she has a clue that there are numerous breathtaking places that just cannot be reached by flying. According to Lisa, Kriel's not to enthused with the fact that she can only hear about the rumors of Aqua Road and not being able to go there in person. Anyway, Lisa suggested that I buy Kriel &quot;The Official Aqua Road Photo Album&quot; from #bMuse#k. Muse, huh... Another trip underwater... \n\n#i4031310# #t4031310#   #b#c4031310##k / 1" />
        <string name="2" value="I gave Muse 100 snow crystals and purchased the Official Aqua Road Photo Album, then gave it to Kriel for the viewing. After seeing her admit how beautiful Aqua Road is, I must say I felt validated by it, but it also seems like she set the whole thing up for this from the get go. Oh well, at least Kriel's happy, and that's good enough for me." />

I'm sure each and every one of them are here to observe the world from an elevated stand point, but as a fairy, I really don't understand the need to see from up there, since I can just straighten up the wings and fly wherever you want. \r\n#b#L0#But there are places you can't go with the wings on, a place like Aqua Road.#l#k" />

I have seen the ocean from up here a million times, and seriously, what's so incredible about a huge body of blue water? Lisa went there a few days ago and came back with nothing but praise about Aqua Road, but it's nothing compared to what we the fairies see. \r\n#b#L0#No, no! Aqua Road is a beautiful place. You'll see what I mean if you ever get to go there.#l#k" />
            <string name="2" value="I don't think I can believe you. There's no place in the world as beautiful as Orbis, where the fairies reside. My opinion may change, however, if you show me, Say, a photo album full of Aqua Road pictures..." />
