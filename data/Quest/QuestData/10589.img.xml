            <string name="2" value="It was safe before, but now things have changed. As more outsiders come to the Golden Temple, its holy energy is diminishing, while the power of Ravana seems to be growing. At this rate, the Ravana may be able to break through the seal in no time. \r\n#L0##bThat sounds horrible! What can be done about it?#l\n#k" />
