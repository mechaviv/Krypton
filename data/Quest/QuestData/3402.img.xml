Chury wanted to show this to Hoony, so he asked me if I could show the Blueprint Machine to Hoony, as well as provide him with #b20 Space Foods#k, for he had been away at the Field for a while. Space Food, huh... I think I can find them through Barnard Gray the alien. I'll run into on the way to the Field. \n\n#t4000117# #b#c4000117##k/20" />
        <string name="2" value="I met up with Chury somewhere around the Omega Sector Silo. Chury wanted me to show the Blueprint Machine to Hoony, as well as give him some food. In turn, I gave Hoony some Space Food to last him a while, and showed him the Blueprint Machine." />

He's much more than I thought! Anyway, please take this #b#t4031100##k and show it to #b#p2050006##k, who should be at a field around Omega Sector.
