He made a bunch of them that look like me.  &lt;Blushes&gt;  I know, it's a little embarrassing.  But I'm not looking for just any doll... I'm looking for my favorite!  I've been looking all over the house for it. \r\n\r\n#L0##bWhat does your doll look like?#l#k" />
            <string name="2" value="It's the first one that Daddy ever made for me.  Her name is Annabelia.  She's not as fancy as some of his new dolls, and I haven't had a chance to clean her so she might be a little dirty.  Daddy keeps making fancier and fancier dolls.  But to me, Annabelia's very special.  I'm old enough to know she's just a doll but she's been my friend since I was a baby.  I... I feel like I've been looking for her forever.  If you find her, would you mind returning her to me?" />
