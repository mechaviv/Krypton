            <string name="1" value="You want to know what the War of Pang Pang is about, right? It's a game that consists of two players. What you'll need to bring are ... a piece of paper and a pencil.\nThe rules are very simple! The two players will draw a dot on the paper. That'll be your area. Then, the game begins.\nOn top of that dot, place your pencil perpendicular to the paper, and place your index finger gently on top of the back of the pencil. \nSlide that finger down, and the pencil will draw a line as a result. \nThat represents the bullet that left your area!\n" />
