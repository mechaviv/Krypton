        <string name="1" value="I met up with Roly-Poly 8 again at Eos Tower. He seemed worried that there's a lot of places to fix at Eos Tower, only to have the monsters stop him from doing so. He asked if I could take out #b25 #o3230103#es#k and collect #b20 Plastic Crowns#k in the process. I can do this... \n\n#o3230103# #r#a32241##k\n#t4000100# #b#c4000100##k/20" />
        <string name="2" value="I took out a bunch of #o3230103#s and collected #c4000100#s just the way the Roly-Poly 8 of Eos Tower asked. How long is this maintenance job going to last anyway? This should get done soon so I don't have to do them any more favors." />
