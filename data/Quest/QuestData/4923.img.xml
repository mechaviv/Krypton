            <string name="1" value="Well, I always envisioned a place where those could come and live their dreams. When I arrived here, there was nothing, just the jungle and the machinery that was left. I had some help in building this place in exchange for a favor... \n\n#L0##bWhat kind of favor?#k#l" />

            <string name="3" value="You're on the continent of Masteria. There's an old legend that surrounds the continent, but you're standing in the rebuilt portion of Olde Sapp Village. There's an old saying that Masteria is where warriors of all kinds come to master their fate. The continent has risen once more from the sea, and people of all kinds are here, some good, some bad. We're clearing a path deeper into the continent, who knows what we'll find? \n\n#L0##bWait, wait?the city was already here?#k#l" />
            <string name="4" value="Not exactly. This was once known as Olde Sapp Village, and was smaller than what you see here. Essentially, Masteria has an old fable, but I'm not sure you'd want to hear about that...\n\n#L0##bYou mentioned it had &quot;risen from the sea&quot; I'd like to hear about how it sunk sometime...#k#l" />
            <string name="5" value="It's only an old fable, I'm sure it wouldn't interest you. Maybe if you help out around the city, I can tell you some more..." />
