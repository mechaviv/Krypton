        <string name="0" value="A middle-aged gentleman who laims to have been the leader of a Family for 30 mind-boggling years... the rumors about this man, #bCaptain Al#k, who can be found in #bLith Harbor#k and #bOrbis Park#k, are running rampant. What exactly is a Family and the Leader anyway? It sounds interesting... better ask #bCaptain Al#k that question myself." />
        <string name="1" value="#bCaptain Al#k seemed much more pleasant the rumors suggested. I have a lot to ask... and he said ask him when I'm ready. How about now?" />
        <string name="2" value="Captain Al's passion for adventure the Family are palpable. Forget the tear-jerking adventures of Captain Al; I'm more interested in the concept of the Family... \nFortunately, Captain Al told me to ask him anytime about the Family. Should I become a Leader myself? Well, first I'll need to find a Junior I can support." />

                <string name="1" value="Just know that... we're talking about 30 years worth of stories. The last thing I want to do is meander into the unknown and get lost in my train of thoughts, so please give me a little bit of time. Just a little bit. My stories will be unlike anything you have ever heard anywhere else, so I want you to be ready to soak it all in. Let me know when you are ready to listen." />

            <string name="0" value="Hmmm... I apologize for making you wait. I'm glad there's someone out there eager to listen to my story. Here's the deal." />
            <string name="1" value="I cannot talk to you about my life story without mentioning the Family, which has been with me through thick and thin for the past 30 years. Before that, I was a stubborn explorer who wanted to travel alone and take care of things myself. I was a good enough fighter to save my town and slay a giant monster with horns all by myself. And then... one day, that all changed." />
            <string name="2" value="After battling a three-headed giant of a monster for over a week, I needed some time to recuperate. That's when I saw two young, green explorers that seem to have just completed their job advancements battling the same monster. They seemed to be constantly on the ropes and on the verge of death...\nIn the end, when the monster avoided their attacks and was getting ready to finish them off, I threw two bottles of expensive potions at them to save them from certain death. That's when I had an epiphany." />
            <string name="3" value="Ah! There are lots of explorers out there that aren't as skilled as I was... I can't leave them like that! That's when I made up my mind to help those two out. I called those two #bJuniors#k, since it was kind of like me taking care of them as only a parent would, and they started calling me #bSenior#k in response." />
            <string name="4" value="I taught those two everything I learned as an explorer, and I gave them the weapons and items they needed to survive in this world. Was it worth it? Oh yes. They used my weapons and potions to achieve greatness in their own rights, so my reputation went that much higher. How can I save money by not giving them the total support they deserve?" />
            <string name="5" value="Soon, they started raising Juniors of their own, and other explorers started calling me #bCaptain Al#k and referred to my Family as the #bAl Family#k. Let me tell you, we were that much more powerful than other exploreres! We were already well-known in the world of Maple, and with our rising fame and rep, we were able to enjoy the #rEntitlement#k as well... " />
            <string name="6" value="This Entitlement is really something to behold. If you ever get a chance to enjoy these Entitlements yourself, you'll surely feel sorry for those that aren't. Hmm, anyway, I took my Family all over the place exploring, but I made one crucial mistake, and that was huge enough for me to lose their trust in me." />
            <string name="7" value="I fell for the devious spell of the Black Magician and I was unable to emerge from it for 11 years! Without my help, my Juniors started experiencing numerous problems and in the end, they decided to part ways and searched for the Senior that would be there for them. If you become the Leader yourself, you'll need to make sure not to repeat the problems I made, like leaving the Juniors out in the cold. Understood?" />
            <string name="8" value="I appreciate you listening to my long story. I am here right now, trying to make up for the colossal mistake I made in the past, and looking for capable Juniors to support while sharing my experiences as a Senior to explorers like you. I sincerely wish your Family well. Did you enjoy my story?" />
            <imgdir name="yes">
                <string name="0" value="I strongly suggest you start your own Family as well. If you wish to start one later, let me know. Until then, best of luck to you." />
