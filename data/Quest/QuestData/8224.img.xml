        <string name="0" value="I've heard people say that there's a band of bandits in the Phantom Forest.  Maybe they're responsible for the travelers that go missing in the woods.  Perhaps I should investigate and see if there is any truth to this story" />
        <string name="1" value="Turns out that these so-called bandits are not responsible for any disappearances, at least so they say.  However, I'm still not really sure why they're camped out here in the middle of these haunted woods.  Their leader, a mysterious tough named #bTaggrin#k, seems quite unfriendly to strangers.  Taggrin said that there was one thing I could do however: #bcut down the possessed Phantom Trees#b and bring him #b50#k of their #bseeds#k.  I'm not sure why he wants them, but I guess the fewer angry trees around the better for everyone. " />
        <string name="2" value="I fulfilled Taggrin's request and brought him the fallen seeds from the Phantom Trees.  He seemed to warm up to me for doing this, and has opened the bandit's camp up to me.  Now I can buy and sell things from their provisioner, Mo.  Whew, this has definitely saved me the effort of having to trek all the way back to NLC!" />

Looks like I might have to re-evaluate where you stand in the food chain.  Hmm.  I'll admit you've made these woods a little safer by what you've done.  And for that, you're welcome here in our camp.  " />
