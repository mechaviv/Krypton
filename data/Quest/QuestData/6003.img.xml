        <string name="1" value="#p2060005# said that he not only did more research on #t4031507#, he's discovered a way to make it work! However, he'll need a special perfume from #bChief Tatamo from Leafre Village#k to make #t2270000# which trains the monster. Leafre is in Ossyria, so I've got a bit of a journey on my hands...\n\n#i4031509##t4031509# #b#c4031509#/1#k." />
        <string name="2" value="After a long journey to Leafre, I traveled back to the Aquarium with the perfume in hand and gave it to #p2060005#.

When you train monsters, you shouldn't use #t4031507# as it is. When you use #t4031507# as it is, monsters can become violent. I need something to neutralize #t4031507#. I have an idea, but it will require a bit of a journey on your part..." />

I've done research and apparently, if you put #t4031507# into the perfume bottle, you can calm monsters, making them much easier to train. The power of the bottle can remove the dangerous scent of #t4031507#. Can you get the bottle? Again, I will make it worth your while!" />

You might want to look in the Tiger Ridge map, there should be some rubble lying about--it's actually a portal. Travel through that and you'll be in a new area with the pigs. Use the perfume when you're close to one and you should capture it. After that, equip the Mount and the saddle, and use your Monster Riding skill to call the mount. I hope I can see your trained monster next time you come to the Aquarium!" />
