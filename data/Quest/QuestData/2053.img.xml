        <string name="1" value="I ran into John the fisherman again at Lith Harbor. This time, he wanted to get his wife Blue Viola for her birthday. He asked me to get #b20 Blue Violas#k for him. The scent of Blue Violas last over 500 years...and according to John, they can be found through the mysterious statue again, where the flower may be found. Man ... do I HAVE to go in there again??" />
        <string name="2" value="I got John all #b20 Blue Violas#k. It has a nice scent to it, but 20 of them? Makes my head spin...As a sign of appreciation, John got me a nice glove he found inside a ship. I mean, it looks like someone accidentally left that glove in there...is he allowed to give it to me like that? What if I wear this around town and run into the actual owner of it??" />
