Judging from the #t4161033# that you have in your hand, I guess my wishes have come true... I had a hunch that you'd successfully uncover the truth about #p2111002# and #m261000000#." />

How can I Say anything when I perpetuate the swirling rumors about #p2111002# by not commenting on his innocence?
