        <string name="0" value="When I told Papulatus that I had come from the future, he seemed very interested in learning more about me. I guess he got even more excited when I told him that he, in the future, was doing some pretty major things... Little does he know that he's doing some pretty radical, negative things... Anyway, how am I supposed to get back to the future now?" />
        <string name="1" value="Papulatus asks me to be his guinea-pig for the research he's been working on, which is almost complete. He says he'll send me back into the future where I came from... I don't like the idea that I'm a guinea-pig for his research, but I can't stay in the past like this forever. I guess I should trust Papulatus for now and get back to the future to tell Rolonay about what had happened." />
        <string name="2" value="I don't know if it's a remnant of the power I felt during my transition between dimensions but I've somehow acquired the power to control space and time. I'll call this skill 'Time Lift'. " />

Maybe it's because you created a crack of dimension in an abnormal way, and you may have been affected by the special powers that exist while traveling time. Please have a seat. I'll examine you for a bit." />
