                <string name="1" value="One night, not too long ago, the stars stopped twinkling. The next day, a suspicious visitor arrived in Magatia. He wore a cape that covered his features, and I could tell he was from out of town. I started a conversation with him, hoping to get information." />
                <string name="2" value="He was just plain strange. He kept mumbling to himself, some weird phrase over and over. &quot;#bI've come too far. It's too soon...&quot;#k\nBefore I could question him, he gave Humanoid A the stink eye and disappeared in the alley near the Alcadno Society." />
                <string name="3" value="Late that night, there was a explosion near the Alcadno Society. There were no witnesses, but after that, no one saw the strange man again. The Alcadno Society blames the Zenumists, of course, but they're wrong. I'm pretty sure that man was responsible. He's got a huge secret. I can just feel it." />
                <string name="4" value="I can see in your eyes that you want to pursue that man. Let me offer you some advice. I think he's already left Nihal Desert, so he must have passed through Ariant Station. Go ask #bSyras#k the ticket agent at Ariant Station if he saw anything." />

            <string name="2" value="Hm, I recall two people who fit that description. One passed by around 10AM, the other around 5PM. The first one was a rather extravagant magician, the second was a young warrior in a raggedy cap. The young warrior asked me how to get to Victoria Island. That's about it... Oh, wait! I remember one other person. I saw him at sunrise a few days ago." />
