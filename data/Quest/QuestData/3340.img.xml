I knew there were numerous books downstairs, but I've never opened them before, so I had no clue something like that would be inside the book. Maybe that book might have a clue or two on #p2111002#. I wonder what, if anything, will fit in that hole, though... \r\n#b #L0##bHow about a meso coin?\r\n#L1# How about your fist?\r\n#L2# How about a pill?\r\n#L3# How about #t4031744#?" />
