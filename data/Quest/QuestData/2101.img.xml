The ship that heads to #bOrbis#k should leave every 15 minutes. The station at Orbis is gigantic, and once there, you'll need to switch the flight to the ship that heads to #bLudibrium#k. At Ludibrium, it  features two humongous towers, and you need to head over to #bHelios Tower#k and descend your way all the way down until you reach Korean Folk Town." />
