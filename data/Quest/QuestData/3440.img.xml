        <string name="1" value="I met General Maestro, who's in command of a humongous army at the Omega Sector, again. The general said although a perfect solution hasn't been presented yet, there's something for me to do. He wanted me to bring back #b30 Dull Crystals#k and #b10 Dark Crystal Ores#k from the Drum Bunnies at the Eos Tower.\n\n#t4031140# #b#c4031140##k/30\n#t4004004# #b#c4004004##k/10" />
        <string name="2" value="Just like the way General Mastro instructed, I gathered up the #bDull Crystals#k and #bDark Crystal Ores#k from the Drum Bunnies. Hopefully this'll stop the bunnies for a while, but this ain't over. I wonder when peace will actually settle on the Eos Tower." />
