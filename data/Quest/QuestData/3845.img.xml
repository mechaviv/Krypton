            <string name="1" value="Did you know the longest waterway in Maple World is the route that connects Aquarium to Herb Town. Today, we can travel via the Dolphin Taxi, but that was once a life-threatening route. Around the border between Mu Lung Garden and El Nath Mts, there is an area that's surrounded by fog all year long. It's known as the #bSea of Fog#k.\r\n#b#L0#What's the Sea of Fog like?#l\n#k" />
            <string name="2" value="It's a place where the current is unpredictable and a thick fog blinds you. The place is surrounded in a mystique of frequent wrecks and countless terrifying rumors.\r\n#b#L0#What sort of rumors?#l\n#k" />
            <string name="3" value="This is the most famous one: Once, there was a time when pirates roamed the seas, threatening Maple World. One nameless but courageous navy admiral hunted them all down. His fleet was undefeated, until one day it vanished into thin air. Decades later, his fleet reappeared in the Sea of Fog as a ghost ship.\r\n#b#L0#Eek! A ghost ship?#l\n#k" />
            <string name="4" value="Har har. It's only a rumor among sailors. I, myself, have yet to see it. But I thought you'd be interested. Say, how would you like to investigate the ghost ship of the Sea of Fog?" />
