It's because the warm weather led me to fly into Maple World, and now I am lost. I don't know where my friends went... I wonder where they must have flown to by now... What? Why don't I just follow after them?" />
            <string name="1" value="Well, I would like to! But...I can't. The truth is, I'm not really that great at flying yet. Of course, I know the basics. But my wings just aren't that strong! If I can descend from greater heights, I'm sure I'd be able to fly all I want!" />
            <string name="2" value="But going to a high place isn't that easy. In order to climb up high on the tree branches, I have to jump over monsters, but I'm afraid of both jumping and monsters! Say, do you think you could lend me a hand?" />
