This is the only untidy room left, so you've found me at the right place. Fair enough. I have good news and bad news. What would you care to hear first?" />

                <string name="0" value="Very well. Let's start with the bad news. There is a monster, a ghost that is lurking around in some corner of this house. You will either be a conqueror or victim, and God forbid you end up the latter. The good news is that if you defeat this ghost and collect 20 Cursed Dolls, you shall receive a chair as a reward. That's right, a chair. What a thing worth risking your life for, no? Oh, and by the way, it is imperative that you join a party to assist you in your adventure. You certainly won't make it back alive any other way. Go on now, brave fighter!" />

                <string name="0" value="Would you care to know the truth, dear #b#h0##k? That ghost wasn't just any ordinary ghost. It was the ghost of Olivia...the daughter of Master Jonas! She was the neglected, forgotten child. The poor girl, being spurned, returned to the land of the living to seek revenge on her father. After all, she had died of starvation. She starved to her very grave. How can you let your own child die of hunger? " />
                <string name="1" value="But upon her return, she found Master Jonas and his family had long been dead, so she directed her wrath instead to all of Maplekind. From my understanding, she had composed all sorts of traps. But thanks to you, we no longer have to fear. " />
                <string name="2" value="Anyway, here is your reward, as promised. It is #bOlivia's Chair#k. Sit on it, give it away, or use it for firewood. Whatever the case, I'm just glad you didn't become a victim of this cruel twist of fate. What a tragic story. It really is." />
