        <string name="1" value="Kong Ji, who lives at a tavern in Folk Town with her stepmom, is a nice girl who does everything her stepmom asks her to do, however ludicrous the task may be. This time, the stepmom ordered her to fill up a pot with water, but the pot had a hole at the bottom, which made it impossible to fill up the pot. She asked me if I could get her a new #t4031230#. I heard that Grandma Yeon, who lives at the place where the water mill is, sells pots, and if I keep her up to date on his husband's whereabouts, then she may give me the pot. \n\n#t4031230# #b#c4031230##k/1" />
        <string name="2" value="I gave Kong Ji, who was panicking because her pot had a hole at the bottom, the #t4031230# that Grandma Yeon made at the water mill. Apparently, Grandma Yeon only sells these pots to the closest few. I should go check on Kong Ji again down the road." />
