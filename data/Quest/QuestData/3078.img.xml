        <string name="1" value="I met #b#p2060101##k in between #m230040400# at an empty ship that's been wrecked. He said he's been looking for the traces of his missing men. He came down here to check out the irregular activities that have been taking place here, and one day he lost contact with his men. Not only did he lose them, but he said the path to the bottom of the ocean is blocked too, so he asked me for help on looking for traces of his men. I should wander around looking for #bitems that can be used as evidence#k. If the items the men have used are still here, then maybe the #bsharks#k that have been roaming around #b#m230040400##k is the one to blame... I should find a #bflashlight#k, a #bcamera#k and a #bnotebook#k, and give them back to #b#p2060101##k." />
        <string name="2" value="#p2060101#, whom I've met at #m230040400#, asked me to find traces of his men that have disappeared. I was able to gather up the flashlight, the camera, and the notebook that his men used at the time of the attack. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any of the missing men." />

Not only that, but ever since they went missing, the path that leads to the bottom of the ocean has been blocked by a black fog. Something doesn't feel right. Please help me find at least the traces left behind by my men." />
