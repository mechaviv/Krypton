            <string name="1" value="Yes ... I actually saw it myself a while ago. Minar Forest consists of an endless sea of green trees, and for it to feature a red tree ... the reason the forest featured all those green trees was because the forest has been protected by the great power of a dragon called Nine Spirit, creating a force field that protected the forest from harm.\r\n#L0# #bWhat kind of a dragon is Nine Spirit?#k" />
            <string name="2" value="Nine Spirit is the leader of all the dragons that reside in Minar Forest. It is also the looming presence that serves to protect this forest. We the Hafrings are responsible for nurturing its eggs until its birth, and it protects us in return. This is the reason why when the tree turned red, we cannot ignore this matter. Say, if you are not that busy, can you do me a favor?" />
