I was able to slay him, but as a result, I lost all my powers and in the end, became part of the sword. The sword, that had just lost its owner was also bound to my remains. Now, try pulling this sword out. It will not move. This sword is utterly immovable, even the remains of the spirit... my sword became the immovable sword.." />

With the #bMonster Eraser#k, the evil forces from it will awaken the power of the sword that had laid dormant. With that power, the sword will be able to be removed. But don't think about hastily awakening the sword. This sword is already a part of the ashes, and when the powers are reawaken, it'll be surrounded by the flames of Salamdander... which means no one will be able to touch it." />
