If that really is what I want for this to happen,  then I have no choice but to hand in #t1102135# and the note to #p2111000#." />

That's...#b#t4161033##k?! ...I see... so you have uncovered the mystery behind #p2111002#'s research... and the secret behind the origin of #m261000000# that may have had to be revealed anyway..." />
            <string name="1" value="Sigh... Do not give me that look of anger. I admit it. I admit that #p2111002# did nothing wrong. I knew that his experiments were a tad risky to say the least, but... the fact that #p2111002# took all the blame for the war... It's only right that isn't guilty in any sense..." />
            <string name="2" value="But, if you think about it, the alchemists at #m261000000# shouldn't be guilty of anything. They were just guilty of being too diligent with their studies. If they find out the truth about the history of town... if they find out that all the spells and methods have been derived from Black Magic? and if they get looked down upon for that very fact... then how do you think they would feel?" />
            <string name="3" value="Alchemists are dark, closed, and insulated by heart, but they are also very proud of their work. They won't be able to handle the truth that they are derived from Black Magician. So many of the brilliant alchemists will cease work. #m261000000# will also be torn apart, never to recover... Do you honestly feel that #p2111002#'s experiment is enough to bring the whole town in flames?" />
            <string name="4" value="Impossible. I can't just let that happen. That's the reason why I had withheld the information on the alchemists... and if I was put in that position again right after the explosion, I'd do the same thing. Please understand this as a Zenumist alchemist.&#x9;" />
