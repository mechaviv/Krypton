I'll need to find Dogon's HQ, which is hidden somewhere around the Fields nearby Omega Sector, find #bDogon's Report#k from the box at the Dogon's HQ, and give them to Chury." />
        <string name="2" value="I gave Chury, who was waiting for me at the Silo of the Omega Sector, the #bDogon's Report#k that I found from Dogon's secret base. I can't believe someone is actually helping aliens... now THAT's quite shocking." />

It seems like there is a group of people that chose to ignore the danger that lies with the aliens, and instead have begun to SUPPORT them. If this is true, then we're in deep trouble, and I'll really need help from someone like you. Will you help us out one more time?" />

Like I previously mentioned, a few alien supporters have built #bDogon's HQ#k at a hidden area around Omega Sector, and have been providing classified information to the aliens. I knew the aliens have been becoming more powerful by day, but this..." />

We need to find their hidden base and find an item that can be used as an evidence. I'm sure there's a #breport#k that's being sent to the aliens by the alien-supporters.

We really have a group of alien-supporters that provide information beneficial to aliens. This is very troubling... anyway, since you found their base, as well as bringing the #breport#k here with you, I can't express enough thanks for your hard work. As a reward, here's some money, as well as a pair of earrings." />
