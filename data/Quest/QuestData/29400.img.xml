The Monk of Honor, Dalair, is looking for a clever hunter who has stamina.  Anyone who completes this task will receive the title, #e#bVeteran Hunter#k#n.  I heard that the person with the highest score will receive another title called #e#bLegendary Hunter(Special Title)#n#k..." />

Dalair said that if I want to become the '#bLegendary Hunter#k', don't forget the hunting record resets every 1st day of each month.  Oh, he also said if I lose the Veteran Hunter medal, I have to redo the challenge so I should make sure to take good care of it." />
