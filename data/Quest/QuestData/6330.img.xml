The path to greatness is filled with treacherous obstacles, one that you'll have to continuously walk on. Hmmm... from looking at you, I can sense that you need that extra something." />
            <string name="2" value="That's the attitude I've been looking for. I'll teach you a new skill that'll blow you away. Under one condition, that is... You may be a Buccaneer, but you may not have reached the level that I want you to be in. If you pass the test I give you, then and only then will I give you the new skill." />

If you can withstand the attack, then you'll be good. I won't go easy on you, so you may want to really prepare yourself for this test. Now, let me know when you're ready to take on the challenge." />
