        <string name="1" value="Apparently, the member of the Black Wings has yet to escape Ereve. If we just search the island thoroughly, we may be able to find the culprit.

Once I find him, I'll need to defeat him in a battle and bring back #b#t4032101##k in the process. The problem is that the enemy, being the #o9001009#, is adept at transforming into different persons, so I better talk to each and every one of them to figure out who's real or fake. \n\n#o9001009##r #a203021##k\n#i4032102# #t4032102# #b#c4032102# / 1#k" />

We detected an intrusion, but we were unable to spot the fake. So while people were panicking, the thief brazenly breezed through and stole the treasure." />
