It is true that I've been friends with her for years, but this time, she really took off without much of a word...I've gone everywhere, going to every place that had anything to do with her, to no avail. Hella left home soon after #blosing her mother a few months ago#k. It ... will be hard to find her. I think you should give up on the search, too." />
            <string name="1" value="You are not giving up, are you? Well, I have one place I can think of right this minute. I remember Hella mentioning her #bkeepsake from her late mother#k the other day. One day it got stolen by someone, and I think she may have gone looking for it. Maybe that's what she did. #bElma the Housekeeper#k may know a thing or two about it so how about going back to Hella's house and ask Elma about it?" />
