            <string name="1" value="Here is your first question. The favors or requests of the citizens of Maple World are called 'Quests.' In order to view the quests that are available to you, or to check the quests that you have either completed or are currently in the process of completing, what hotkey do you press?\n#b#L0#A#l\n#L1#I#l\n#L2#Q#l\n#L3#Z#l\n#k" />
            <string name="2" value="Here is the second question. You can acquire items by completing a quest, hunting monsters, or breaking boxes.

            <string name="3" value="Here is your third question. Earning EXP allows you to level up, and leveling up allows you to earn Skill Points. How many Skill Points do you receive each time you level up after you've become a Knight at Lv.10? \n#b#L0#1#l\n#L1#3#l\n#L2#5#l\n#L3#10#l\n#k" />
            <string name="4" value="Here is your fourth question. In Maple World, you can defeat monsters by using regular attacks or special skills. But which do you use to break open boxes? \n#b#L0#Regular Attacks#l\n#L1#Skill Attacks#l\n#k" />
            <string name="5" value="Bingo! You have answered all the questions correctly. If you take #t4032269# to the Empress #p1101000#, you will be recognized as a Noblesse of #p1101000# Knights. Would you like to receive the #t4032269# right away?" />
