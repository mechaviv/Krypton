        <string name="1" value="Well, Bartol says that if I fulfill his request then he would give me a coupon that would allow me to use the warp machine to be warped to the Omega Sector. He says that he has some business to attend to with Shulynch, Muirhat and Black Bark and could use my help... " />
        <string name="2" value="I fulfilled Bartol's request and received the Omega Sector Warp Coupon in return. I can use this coupon to use the Warp Machine in The Nautilus' Control Room to be warped immediately to the Omega Sector.  " />

                <string name="0" value="Okay, so you still want to know what it is, right? I'll tell you of a great way to get to Omega Sector at once. Tada! This card is all you need to make a quick trip there! I carried out Muirhat's order once and he gave me this as a reward. Use this card, and you'll have access to the warp portal that heads to Omega Sector. How is there a portal like that, you ask?" />
                <string name="1" value="Dr. Kim of Omega Sector has been lifelong friends with Kyrin. They both share a mutual interest in technology, and they help each other out. When Kyrin built The Nautilus, I heard that Dr. Kim helped out qutie a bit. They still look to one another for technological help, and that's why they built this warp portal." />
                <string name="2" value="If you do me a favor, then I'll give you this card. Your basic trade of the goods, you know. What do you think? I have a list of items that I have to deliver to multiple places, and... if you can do it for me, I'll give you this Warp Card." />
                <string name="3" value="Wait, hold on. I need to organize this list. I need to see Shulynch, Muirhat, and Black Bark... hmmm... talk to me in a bit, okay?" />

                <string name="0" value="Use this to gain access to the machine located at the Navigation Room of The Nautilus and you'll head straight to Omega Sector. Without this card, however, this machine will not activate. Remember that, okay?" />
                <string name="1" value="Ohh, and one more thing. This Warp Card is only available for one-time use. Once this card is inserted in the machine to activate it, the card will not be returned. Save the card until you really need to use it, you know. If you don't have multiple cards with you, then returning here will be a big problem." />
