        <string name="1" value="I met Green Mesoranger at Boswell Field around Omega Sector. Green Mesoranger said he heard a lot about me through other Mesorangers, and asked if I wanted to tackle a Mesoranger mission. First I decided to help Green Mesoranger by helping his mission to #beliminate 100 Mateons#k.\n\n#o4230119# #r#a34351#" />
        <string name="2" value="I took out 100 Mateons, just the way Green Mesoranger from Boswell Field asked. The duties of the Mesorangers don't seem to be over, though, so if I have some time to spare, then I maybe I should go check Green Mesoranger then." />

From what I've heard, you're quite a strong person, and... you know what, why don't you and I take care of some missions as the member of the Mesorangers? Of course, the Sector will recognize your work and pay you accordingly." />
