        <string name="1" value=" After reaching Leafre, I spoke with #p2081000#. He confirmed that he does have a way to improve my mount--by turning it into a powerful dragon! However, like most good things in life, this is not free. He's agreed to sell me the dragon's perfume for the low, discounted price of #r12 million meso#k because it is rare. Really rare. So rare, in fact, that he still has his original stockpile. At 20 Million mesos per, I'm not surprised..." />
        <string name="2" value="After thinking it over, I gave #p2081000# 20 million mesos and got the dragon's perfume. I took a whiff, it smells like candy, chocolate, and roses...I'm tempted to drink it! However, I want an awesome dragon mount, so I'll have to pass. I can't wait to ride it!" />
