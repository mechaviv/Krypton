        <string name="1" value="I gave Nella 1000 mesos as a commission for hooking up Kerning City citizen's request. First request was to get the materials for Don Hwang, the owner of armor shop. The materials for making new armor are #b50 Green Mushroom caps#k and #b50 Bubbling's huge bubbles#k. It wouldn't be that hard, since I can easily find Green Mushrooms near the Ellinia and Bubblings at the Subway." />
        <string name="2" value="I gave what Don Hwang asked for and I got bunch of lemons for return. I wonder what kind of armor would Don Hwang make. Nella said there are many more requests I can do. I should visit Nella every once in a while." />
