This is great; I need to ask you for a small favor. My brother and I live here in this town, farming for a living. We harvested our crop a few days ago, but something's been nagging me ever since. I have equally split the #t4031229# between my brother and myself, but my brother takes care of my parents, and I seriously believe my brother deserves a little more of #t4031229#, but I know he won't accept it. That's why ... can you please secretly put one #t4031229# on top of the stack of rice in front of my brother's house?" />
