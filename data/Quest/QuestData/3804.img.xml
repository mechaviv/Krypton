        <string name="0" value="The document that contains all the mysterious skills necessary to become the Master. I found all the loose pages, but #b#p2091001##k looked concerned as he ran through #t4000299#. What's the problem now? When will he make me a Master? I better talk to #p2091001#." />
        <string name="1" value="After looking through #t4000299#, #p2091001# stated that there were cat footprints everywhere, and concluded that some street cats may have read the document and secretly obtained those skills. #p2091001# stressed that there should not be cats like those roaming around the forest, for they'll present danger to all of us. He asked that I eliminate #r20 #o6130209#s#k for him, and bring back #b5 #t4031433#s#k...\n\n#t4031433# #b#c4031433##k/5  \n#o6130209#  #r#a38041##k" />
        <string name="2" value="After eliminating #o6130209#s and bringing back #t4031433#s, #p2091001# commended me for the job well done, but refused to hand me #o5120506#. He mentioned that the document will allow me to obtain those skills, but learning the skills that way would make me no different than those street-cats-turned-monsters, and recommended that I train slowly but surely. That, and only that, he said, would allow me to become the true Master. Sigh... that all went for a naught, but he did say the right thing. When will I become the true Master?" />

Look at these pages, all of them stamped in cat footprints. Don't you think they look a little strange to be considered just a regular cat footprint?" />
            <string name="1" value="Word is, lately there have been a number of #bmonsters that cry like a cat#k emerging around the Peach Farm. I suspect that these street cats might have read #o5120506# and acquired its mysterious skills themselves. Those street cats are violent to begin with, but now that they are equipped with those skills, the cats present a major problem for all of us. I'd like for you to take care of this situation. Can you?" />

Don't be fooled by its appearance; you will be viciously attacked. As for #t4031433#, we'll need to destroy those monsters and gather up the #t4031433# so it won't be spread out to other street cats." />

This was a crude reminder that these skills are definitely not for the unprepared and the untrained. I am sure you may be able to master those skills in no time without the proper training, but that doesn't mean you can call yourself a Master. In fact, you won't be any different from those monsters you just defeated." />
                <string name="1" value="This applies to anyone and everyone: the best way to become the Master is to train diligently and pay dues. Once you find yourself helping others in need without even thinking, that's when you'll have proven to be Master material. Don't be discouraged by this; keep training, keep working hard, and never stray from this goal. You'll eventually become the true Master you are striving to become." />
