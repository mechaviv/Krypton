        <string name="0" value="The polearm introduces itself as Maha and demands that you remember him. What are you supposed to do? You'd better consult #b#p1201000##k about this." />
        <string name="1" value="#p1201000# states that the voice is really #p1201001#'s voice, and that you need to remember something about #p1201001# to appease him. If you head west of #b#m140000000# to #m140030000##k, you'll find the Mirror of Desire, which has the power to display whatever you desire. Maybe you should check it." />
        <string name="2" value="You were able to faintly encounter your past through the mirror. You saw the time you first got your polearm. When you mentioned the story, #p1201002# seemed relieved. Thanks to #p1201002#'s help, you were able to recover some of your dormant abilities." />

            <string name="0" value="Seriously what happened to your polearm? What? The #p1201001# talked to you in a human voice? Hmmm…that's really something. It is recorded that the heroes' weapons have identities of their own and talk like human beings, but I didn't think much of it. I guess it's true though." />
            <string name="1" value="If it really is the voice of the polearm, then you'll need to pay attention. Just like #p1201001# said, you must find a way to get back your memory concerning #p1201001#. But how can... Wait a minute! I actually know of an item that may be perfect for this!" />
            <string name="2" value="Head west, past town, and you'll reach a dead end made of ice cliffs. Inside an ice cave around there, you'll find a mirror made of ice known as the #b#m140030000##k. " />
            <string name="3" value="This mysterious mirror that was made by one of the workers from a long time ago is called the #bMirror of Desire#k, because it shows what you desire deep inside your heart, but it doesn't show EVERYTHING, so it's a bit hard to use." />
            <string name="4" value="The mirror only shows things that are directly related to you, and it only shows the concrete person or thing of your desire, nothing abstract. You need to really focus on a specific target and desire to see that target in the mirror, and it will appear." />
            <string name="5" value="Your memories are too broad and abstract, which is too much for the Mirror of Desire to handle. But now we have a specific target, your polearm, so you may actually get to see something. Go ahead and try it." />
