        <string name="1" value="I met Rice the Medic at the Omega Sector, and he asked for my help to gather up some items to make various kinds of medicine. He said he needed #b100 Mateon Tentacles#k, which can be obtained by taking out the aliens. It's quite amusing to think that the alien tentacles can be used as an ingredient to make medicines. Rice really wanted me to keep it a secret, since this was something even the famous Dr. Pepper was unaware of, and he's thinking of making a patent out of it. Well, time to collect some tentacles! \n\n#t4000120# #b#c4000120##k/100" />
        <string name="2" value="Rice the Medic of Omega Sector requested the #b100 Mateon Tentacles#k, and I gathered up all of them. Will the research start now? I wonder what kind of the antidote this will produce. I should go see Rice right about the time when the tentacles run out." />

Lately the aliens have been applying substantial damage to our army through lethal dose of poison, and we still haven't found a way to cure that. Fortunately, we've figured out the main reason behind the poisonous attack." />
