About a time when Onyx Dragons and Dragon Masters lived in harmony and how the Onyx Dragon's suddenly became extinct...

You are sent to a strange place...\r\n\r\n#bInside #p1205000#'s memory, become Freud, who was his master, and talk to him.#k." />
        <string name="2" value="Hundreds of years ago, the Onyx Dragons were destroyed because of the Black Mage. #p1205000# was entrapped in ice by the Black Mage. From the conversation between Freud and #p1205000#, you can guess that #p1013000# is #p1205000#'s child. But it doesn't seem that #p1205000# wants #p1013000# to know." />
