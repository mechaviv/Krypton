        <string name="1" value="A committee member? What the...\nI feel like being pushed into this by Sabitrama, but I think it'll be fun solving the riddles of the ancient archives. The archive stated as such. \n\nRegarding the 1st Herb: \nThe spirit of black and white bids adieu to the land and appears before me. Mark on the two silent spirits, and the spirit will intermingle to transform into the 1st Herb\n\nRegarding the 2nd Herb: \nWhat do you think of the one that snuffs loneliness and darkness in the cradle, while the soul is vacated from the body? The soul that cannot return must find a soulmate that shall spend the eternity with. You're the doll, and inside, you shall find the 2nd Herb.\n\nHmmm...where do I begin?" />
        <string name="2" value="Being called a committee member stinks, but I got paid well, and it was fun. The clues to the 3rd Herb are still nowhere to be found, but ... I actually feel like helping him out once more.\nI should drop by sometime later." />

            <string name="1" value="Thank you. \nAs you know, Area 7-2 is the sacred ground for herbs, \nand the reason why I've lived here for a very long time is because I can always collect the vast array of herbs that are readily available. It's also because I'm also looking for something totally different." />

            <string name="6" value="Don't look at me suspiciously like that.\nOnce I find this, this may parlay into a ton of money! I'm not interested in it, however.\nIf I get to solve the riddle of this archive, and find the Big 3, rest assured I'll be rewarding you accordingly." />
            <string name="7" value="What do you think? Do you want to join the forces? \nI would love to solve the ancient riddle with a bright mind like you! \n...ah, and while &quot;The Big 3&quot; is considered scientifically brilliant, the actual medicinal effect may be in question..." />

                <string name="5" value="Regarding the 3rd Herb, I'll search through other books for clues. I'd appreciate it if you can solve the first two riddles for me.\nCan you do it?\nIn times like this, instincts play a big role in solving the riddles! \nPlease think carefully before acting out on it." />
                <string name="6" value="I think, regarding the 1st Herb, I'll have to find the &quot;spirit of black and white&quot;. Without the two, it'll be difficult to obtain the herb.\nGood luck, committee member!" />

            <string name="5" value="The spirit of black and white... that were the pieces of Dark Stone Golem and Golem! Those pieces of rock sure had something elaborate on the surface. So the herb that fed off the mystical power emitted from this rock...that was the 1st Herb!" />
            <string name="6" value="And the 2nd Herb. \nAn abandoned doll without a soul... I kind of knew what that meant, but ...hmmm, yes, another presence that stayed in the same body, the Death Teddy that controls the doll. The controlled dolls were made out of cotton, and the cotton was the 2nd Herb!" />
            <string name="8" value="Alright, so far there's no clue out regarding the 3rd Herb. I'll let you know when the time is right. This is your reward.
