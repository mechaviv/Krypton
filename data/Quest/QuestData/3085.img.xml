I couldn't see the dish because it was inside a box, but judging from the tasty aroma that filled the room, I knew this was indeed a winner. #p2060006# warned me that this was best eaten when hot, and wanted me to get this to #b#p2060000##k before it turned cold. Basically, I have #r1 hour#k to deliver this to #b#p2060000##k. Can I do this?" />
        <string name="2" value="I delivered the food that #p2060006# made to #p2060000# on time. I had to really run to make it here in 1 hour. Phew, at least seeing #p2060000# chow down on the dish made it all worthwhile." />
