        <string name="1" value="I'm thinking it's Versalmas for me this year!  All I have to do now to cement my decision is to actually give Little Suzy's Wishlist to O-Pongo.  I can't wait!  It's time for a change of pace!" />
        <string name="2" value="Looks like I'm celebrating Versalmas this year!  I gave #bLittle Suzy's Wishlist#k to O-Pongo, and he gave me this awesome #bVersalmas Hat#k for me to wear proudly!  Every time I bring O-Pongo presents I've collected from monsters, he'll reward me; I'll now be able to redeem presents to him in batches of #b10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, or 100#k.  I'll get different rewards at different tiers; the more presents I bring at one time, the better the rewards!  I'll need to bring him presents appropriate to my level though.\r\nBringing O-Pongo more presents will also help me earn #bVersalmas Cheer#k!  If the total amount of #bVersalmas Cheer#k accumulated on my world beats out the total amount of #bMaplemas Spirit#k, O-Pongo will have something really nice for me at the end of the event!" />

What did she Say?\r\n\r\n#b#L0#She asked me to handle her wishlist for her... and sign both of us up for Versalmas celebrations this year!#l#k\r\n#b#L1#Suzy asked me to make the decision for her... and I'm thinking that Maplemas is the right holiday for us Maplers.#l#k" />
            <string name="1" value="Glad to hear it!  One thing you must realize, before you decide, is that by celebrating Versalmas, you will not be able to celebrate Maplemas as you have done before, nor speak with Maple Claws to finish her quest. You won't be able to change your mind later!\r\nCome back when you're sure, and I'll take #bLittle Suzy's Wishlist#k from you then! Okay?" />

Please understand though, if you choose to celebrate Maplemas this year, you'll no longer be able to exchange presents you find with me for Versal gifts.  Unfortunately, I only have a limited number of my Versal items so I need to give them out to those who are celebrating Versalmas this year.  But, what is it that you say... oh, right, have a Merry Maplemas then!  But I'll wish you a Happy Versalmas as well!" />

Now you can bring me presents in batches #b30, 40, 60, or 90!#k  Like I said before, you get different rewards at different tiers; and the more presents you bring at one time, the better the rewards! Please remember that you can only redeem a total of #b100 Presents#k per day.  And if you bring me #b100 presents#k, I'll give you a #bVersalmas Cactus#k of your very own!" />
                <string name="1" value="In addition, let's show Maple Claws the spirit of some friendly competition as well!  For each #b10 presents#k you collect for me, I'll reward you with #b1 Orb of Versalmas Cheer#k, in addition to your regular reward. So if you redeem 60 presents, you'll get your reward plus #b6 Orbs of Versalmas Cheer#k!  The more presents you return, the more Versalmas Cheer we'll create in this world.  If we create more #dVersalmas Cheer#k than #bMaplemas Spirit#k this year, I promise to reward every player who has chosen Versalmas with something special at the event end!  So find those presents for me, and hold on to those #bOrbs#k!" />
