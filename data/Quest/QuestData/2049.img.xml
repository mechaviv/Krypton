        <string name="1" value="At Ellinia, I ran into a fairy that's been busily studying the magic of life. Her name is &quot;Mar&quot; and after taking a look at my pet that's been turned into a doll, she told me she can make it come back alive with #bThe Water of Life#k and #bThe Scroll of Life#k. I heard that she knows Cloy of Henesys... since it looks like a pet trainer named #bTrainer Bartos#k of Henesys knows something about the scroll of life, I should head over there... " />
        <string name="2" value="After easily passing the test from Trainer Bartos of Henesys, I got a hold of #bThe Water of Life#k and #bThe Scroll of Lifel#k, and got that to &quot;Mar&quot; the fairy. With her magical power and the items I got her, she turned the doll back into a living pet. I can hang out with him for a while longer now ... sweet ..." />
